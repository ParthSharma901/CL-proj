You are free to roam around and do your masti anywhere in the campus as long as its safe, but kindly understand that labs are supposed to be quiet places as there are hundred of students focusing on their studies, research, etc-. Moreover, a lot of profs have their offices as well. Take this as a reminder and ensure there is a certain decorum maintained in these places. More so because you are not even allowed here in the first place. Don't make us call you out.
