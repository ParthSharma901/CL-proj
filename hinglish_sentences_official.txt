Guys, as you know, Chicken Pox is spreading. So be a little more careful about your hygiene and try to avoid close contact with people for some time. And inform the Parliament if you happen to have any symptoms. Stay Safe and atb for endsems and projects!
Adding to that plss pls take note: 1. Initial symptoms include rashes (which may be accompanied by blister in later stage) 2. Fever (low or high either) 3. Fatigue and loss of appetite Also symptoms take a week or more to actually show up ... So ppl might b infected but themselves be unaware of the same So pls try to not b in crowded places at least. And people who have had it in the past or are vaccinated are less prone but can still get it . So pls be careful anyway ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Reminder! Deadline 6PM.

Hey everyone, hope you are doing well, now that exams are over. We expect civil behavior from you all in and around the labs (T-Hub, KCIS, Vindhya). You are free to roam around and do your masti anywhere in the campus as long as its safe, but kindly understand that labs are supposed to be quiet places as there are hundred of students focusing on their studies, research, etc-. Moreover, a lot of profs have their offices as well. Take this as a reminder and ensure there is a certain decorum maintained in these places. More so because you are not even allowed here in the first place. Don't make us call you out.
Please guys, you are ideally not allowed to enter lab spaces. Do not take advantage over our leniency. Research students are working at various times in their labs and before they start complaining about you guys, try to control your behavior. There are a lot lot more places in campus to have fun, lab spaces aint them. Anyways Happy holidays, ab toh baahar ghoom lo before sem starts again :)
ghum rahe hai sir yeh log kabse kahtam hi nahi ho raha inka üòÇ
Kids if anyone missed any endsems please do note this
guys please cross roads safely üôè
basically rule of thumb: only attempt crossing if you think you can cross it at a go, do not stop in the middle of the road.
random question: does ug1 not prefer going to bbc? i generally have not noticed a lot of ug1s here! (react with üëç/üëé)
I think its coz BBC is very far from OBH ü§°
perhaps.
thumbs up means you generally go to BBC.
By the time they wake up, they have classess.. so automatically VC > BBC
damn imagine not eating the better dosa
Bbc dosa not better

A lot of people have been falling sick lately. If you need medicines urgently, please ask your roommates, or friends if they have the common ones with them. Also, you can purchase medicines on Netmeds, Apollo, PharmEasy etc- and then deliver it to your hostel. You can buy a good amount of them to use later on also. Take care and get well soon.
I would suggest get your own candles if possible ‚ù§Ô∏è
