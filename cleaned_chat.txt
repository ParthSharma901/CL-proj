Also that's because manual and biometric both are there for a few days

Hey everyone!  Hope your first class (if it was there) was good. I would like to clarify that the attendance will be counted from class 1 for all UG1 courses. So, make sure to attend all your classes from today only. *This is what I was told by the Academic Office.*  Also, all the cases of probation for UG1 have been resolved by the Academic Office. If you are on academic probation and have not been contacted by the Academic Office for the same, contact Academic Office in person at the earliest.  Also, for anyone, if your courses are not approved at IMS->Academics->My courses, approach any MP.
Attend all your classes, try to keep a buffer, and don't approach if your attendance is below the required criterion at the end of semester.
omg sanyam learning and citing his sources
love to see it
When the source is not trusted, we should convey
are we witnessing the next aaryan shah!?
Sanyam spitting fax 😂 No iiit source is trustworthy lmao
always imitated never duplicated 🙏🙏
sab notes likh rahe ahi 💀💀
(I'm gonna do that as well once i figure out github :,) 👍)
just make them diff for each course if you can
real
much easier to access later on
dw 3 class ke baad sab chhod denge
½ ke class ke bad chod dia😭
Bet; what will you give me if i take notes every single class
10 cg grind dw
me++
you will have to share the notes as well then
But you've always done that 💀
I took notes for most of last sem, i can do it again
I already have no idea what's going on in the classes
@918368609506 brother

sure
Mps aren't supposed to miss messages 😔
mai bhi le raha hu tere notes se kya karu mai

Mere notes acche hain 🥰 hope this helps

so youre telling rushils notes are not
ok lets see in endsems
rushil mai na sehta
sem2 beef
Ok ^^
real shit
Classes just started and I've already lost any drive to write notes or pay attention in classes off to a great start
im coming for her mp role in 2-1 😠😠😠😠
I wanna make a bmi joke ffs :(
👀🤷‍♀
😭😭
You can try 🙂 (gais pls vote for me next time also 👍)
Aryan shah was a goat cuz he was a man
sexism ftw
Did u already do that?
wait if ure mp in year 2 can u become apex in year 3
we don't talk about that
No
Not anymore at least
niceee less competition
ok im not coming for ur mp role then❤️
be an mp
ill vote
Earlier you could do mp + apex (rishabh.) Now they don't let you hold too many positions of responsibility
Afaik at least
my brother was apex and debsoc coord i have to carry on legacy 😔
Rishabh goat and a man that's why they allowed
no you can be apex and mp, you just cant be secretary/speaker/gensec apparently
Wait how do these mp and apex roles work
I see i see
vedant aa gaya baatei band karni padegi😔
class monitor samajhke rakha hai kya mujhe 0_0
Mp you get voted in, apex you first become an apex mentor, then out of those ppl, they pick apex members
samajhke?
aap ho
Mp ko class monitor ka bhi position mil gya hai lmao
What does being an mp in year 2 have to do with apex in year 3?
theres a reason youre saved as guruji in everyone phone
bruh ;_;
I've gotten messages that technically were meant for class reps lmao
they generally frown upon you being in multiple student bodies
Apex mentorship in year 2
If you can't be mp and apex, why do the mentorship?
these are the official lecture slides?
So is mp better or apex better?
Yeah
Ig this does match up with fhe no having too many responsibility positions ig
Even this was a thing earlier btw (rishabh.)
none
mp obviously
That is your choice :) (mp is the correct answer)
apex
groom facche
disco pakka aapka
Real
💀*
K maybe I'll try running next year (even tho I'm too retarded for this shit)
you'd actually win
brainrot mp ftw
joshua sar winning elections

Random mess gets assigned week 3 onwards; you can check that in the calendar option under the mess tab in ims

Hello!  Just a reminder about the inter-batch sports tournament. I hope you guys have registered for the same. If not, please register and participate in as many games as you can.  Also, you might have to re-register due to the Microsoft Migration Issues. Check the mail for more info.  Our batch can win the trophy for sure and now it's in your hands to make it happen.  Best of luck and make us proud :)
where shld we submit
Waha likha nahi hai?
Bro asking someone like me to "register and participate in as many games as you can" is a recipe for disaster
Nah

Website of sports council

I would actually give a fuck
No human rights until week 3

Two weeks to let people get used to the system
Week 3? Hopefully not 30 💀
Because he thought ppl would find the 4 day pre registration too new
NO SHIT LMAO

Before you class for sure

Even if it arrives at that time, not an issue na
not for me, no
~Just blame the management and keep sleeping~
Has art been allotted yet?
Nope
Hello! Section A people, you all will receive the Arts-II Allocation before your tomorrow's class. Please attend your class on time.  H2 Allocation results will be announced soon.
acads office at it again ;_;

Why are you guys panicking Arts lite

bro just say no class today then ill chill
Iss is only 1 hour?
Afaik, no?
8:30 to 10:05 no?
Course docs say it's 1 lecture hour per week
But is it really trustworthy?
I wouldn't trust it on the in class test dates bit, at the very least
Course docs ie the sem breakup stuff
Ouh i see
Not the ones for ISS
Yup yup got it
Idk then 🤷‍♀
Guess we'll go to class and find out
Please feel free to create good stickers with this motivation
bruh do we have arts or not i want to sleep
Yeah @917497808993
Go to sleep
Sleep
i’m dead sick i’ve been up for an hour man 😭
That's even more reason to sleep and take rest
You'll receive it before class. Again, it's Acad's office only.
We can start arts from next week

What if it doesn't come?
Crazy that it came now

But karna kya hai, bhukh hadtaal?
hungrr games 👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺
@919708076001 we need answer
Jaldi kar bhai aaj soyabadi bani h😅
Ensure to cancel your meals first 😂
@MPs meal ab cancel kr skte hai kya ???
Idts
Not for week 2 at least
Week 3 ka dekhlo
Hadtal postpone ??????
+1 for sure
Daily meals yeah
Hartal is NOT the solution bro
If you do that the college will let you starve and die
+1
Propose a better idea then
Hartal best
Nuclear bomb
~Burn the college~
This is a good idea
Hack iiit site
And option to save mess choice should also be there. I don't want to login every 2 weeks and register for the messes. Incase I forget to register, then problems happen.
Yeah but also the previous one was just working fine though
They only suddenly have issues with it after the frog lmao
I am ready to do the protest any moment. We can ask them for flexibility of meal choices atleast. When do you want to do the protest? Monday?
Why r u asking broo.. U are our leader... Just tell us the date hm tere peeche milenge

Quick question: what exactly does this protest entail?
Good question ❓ @919708076001
From our mutual understanding we arrive at ki galti se out dab gya tha
We can figure that out. Mainly it's about the flexibility of choosing our meals and meal cancellations. And to question if our opinions actually matter
karna kya hai exactly?
YAYYYY A PROOOTESTTTTT
sounds fun fuck yeah
We can to go girish's office, abhi toh wahi soche hai, otherwise suggest something
gaali allowed?
The reason is pretty obvious, we are all enraged about that, but having a protest without any clear idea of what u r even doing is just kinda stupid
No😂
Are wo to must hai
what about unkind and non polite words in english?
We can think more till Monday, but what I thought is ki we will go to girish office and talk directly, asking for a confirmation as to when things will change
Tu akela bhi to ja skta hai fir to 😂
Upto you, cpro ka grading ke liye toh Dena chahiye
Things will not change
I'm pretty sure he's said that things will change once we can come up with our own website for mess registration
If less people are there, he can easily send us back
We can try still
If there is no protest
Point hai bhai ...
We call ug 2also
Shi baat h bhai
And ug3
And pg
Ye bhi point hai bhai
Phd
Where? And by when will things change? Did he say anything regarding that
Haa bhai naya group bana IIIT Unofficial

He still can revert back to the old system na till the time it doesn't change, that's what the senior mailed also right?
Guide us sar
Acc to him the old system required a lot of manual work and was too inconvenient for them to manage, and that's why he refuses to go back to the old system
But that doesn't mean they will implement a system which no student is in favour of
Well they just did, literally why everyone is enraged
Doesn't seem to bother him though
It doesn't affect him so he doesn't care
That's what we have to do, we have to make sure he cares
We can't compromise, not this time
And how can we do that exactly
Yes, that's the entire point
This is literally why everyone is getting mad at him
I mean if 50-60 people stand at his door, it would change something
not even half of that number will show up 1/4/25, 3:10 PM - Krrish Gupta: ppl already started kassi-ing in workspace
🤫🧏
People will, 50 is not a very tough number to gather I think
We should train an LLM in this group chat (and see how much it scores in Autistic meter)
this grp will be its ultimate training
Damn now we know where kadamb gets its recipes from

Q
Is this the new E 🫴🦋?
Naur, it's the new V
Why do I see two dots (.) in the mail ID
Check that
If we are not going to study DSA in python(as per the votings) would it be taught for the next two weeks or C++?
I mean, python is gonna be anyway gonna be taught in ISS, might as well just study C++ in DSA. But idk what chopella will actually do
It's 1 dot, and for some reasons after giving an error it automatically logged in
Huh, interesting
Does Girish not know how calendar works
He likes to start and end his week with holidays
I thought that they would give choice between python or c or c++ for each student and not for class as a whole.  If so , I feel that it is best that every student has his own choice for all the languages
Dasa ahh week
I agree with THIS honestly
Ehh I'd prefer it if it was the same language for everyone
That's unrealistic  They would have to design 3 separate courses to implement that system
Also they wouldn't be able to teach OR grade at the same standard if that happened
Plus in case of any discrepancy it'd be difficult for us to make arguments
Imagine going to the lab exam, seeing that the questions need you to use a hash map, and spend 1 hour just coding out a proper hash map in C lol The choice ought to just be C++/Py
Yeah
that wouldn't be possible, it'd be like running three different courses simultaneously
Guruji has spoken, end of discussion
aiyeo no dont think like that pls
Nah I'm saying that coz it justifies my opinion
South mess has such skill issue👿
How tf do they not have spoons
😂😂 gold
Imagine eating bad food at mess for high prices (this post was made by the guys who forgor to register for mess)
~u cld just take a plate from the washing area and try sneaking in lol~
Bruh
What is wrong with parents group

Someone is arguing that breakfast should be made mandatory
The breakfast thujgm
??
Ye so retarded
The real question should be what isn't wrong with it
Genuinely
Istg
You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink
Atleast this time some parent was saying that it's ridiculous
But still
But tbf skipping breakfast isn't really a good thing
But you can't like enforce it
Send ss 1/5/25, 2:09 PM - Anish 319 ECE: What if you forget to register in any mess Cuz it's not showing any mess in ims
U for this week u aren't assigned a mess
From next week onwards only if u forget to register u r  randomly assigned a mess 1/5/25, 2:11 PM - Anish 319 ECE: Is pay to eat available? 1/5/25, 2:11 PM - Anish 319 ECE: Cuz I asked in South it was not
In limited quantities
Try North or Yuktahaar
Yes, but the prices r too high to justify eating there, I'd suggest eating in canteens
For abt the same price u can get much better food 1/5/25, 2:12 PM - Anish 319 ECE: True
Man this mess situation is so bad 1/5/25, 2:17 PM - Anish 319 ECE: Tf were they smoking before doing this
Nothings new abt that
They were working in an engineering college
(Very horrible)
Ik right
The worst drug of them all: pride.
Is that an anti-lgbtq statement? /s
💀
Being real those people are fucking snowflakes who think everything they do is right and all students will follow them
I don't think it's a matter of whether it's right or wrong for him it's just whatever makes his life easier at our inconvenience

Ik they do have overlaps but damn the exact same picture
Wat
I thought LA was RA 2.0💀
tq
did anyone write down the running notes for IoT? if so pls send
it most prolly is
It is, iot is more like dsm 2.0 given how much the guy yaps
Shut
It's DSM 2.0
Yapping included
no la is ds 2.0
The sem just started and I've already lost all motivation to pay attention in class
sem 2 is just sem1 2.0
damn
crazy
I lost track already fuc
Damn u had a track?
💀++ bro I slept first CSO class
This shit gay agle sem se roz padhenge😡😡
Most motivation I had for cso was reading the slides once then go back to doomscrolling
At least cso was better than iot
hdy check the new mess menus
Yeah they atleast make it learnable, iot is just messy
All of these are shit
LA ftw

alr thank you 1/6/25, 12:24 PM - Poonam: Sanyam i forgot to register and there's no mess allotted now 1/6/25, 12:24 PM - Poonam: so I just pay every meal or what 1/6/25, 12:24 PM - Poonam: in calendar
You can do that only
Not worth it go to canteens and eat
Though, it's like 12 rs. more per meal 1/6/25, 12:24 PM - Poonam: wait so I won't be charged for breakfast and all
Mostly, yes 1/6/25, 12:25 PM - Poonam: So I'll lose 12 rs per meal but I won't lose money on breakfast 1/6/25, 12:25 PM - Poonam: NAHHHHH
Atleast for 5 meals 1/6/25, 12:25 PM - Poonam: wtf
Can't say, I'll confirm
Mostly, you will not be charged for any meal
@919361140892, no charge till 9th. Just checked 1/6/25, 12:29 PM - Poonam: Why only till 9th :(
start being responsible bro 1/6/25, 12:29 PM - Poonam: after that they'll charge for breakfast? Even if I don't register
cant have careless attitude for 8 sems 🫤🫤
From next week, you will be allotted a random mess
I'm not sure why 9th
I can still hear navanshu screaming abt how ponnam forgot the arduino for their lab
No new week, but it was what we were conveyed
Girish you are not seeing heaven
I think we should block his way and ask him for this messy mess system
And not let him run away
Sentence girish to balls electrocution (tho I doubt he has them)
Tie Girish to a chair and make him listen to Nicki Minaj for 6 hours
Ultimate Torture

Y'know, I think we should add ponnam in that room as well

It’s In spam, So idk
Oh ok got it
Just eat it na,  i dont want jc to now shift to some other ass location
will we have tuts for cso, iot and iss?
cam someone check the syllabus pdf if they have it
ISS doesn't have Tuts according to the course doc, but CSO does
La also must have ig cuz tut quizzes are graded
IOT doesn't have it either, according to the CSX Sem wise plan
thanks
Does anyone know when is the qualification for the chess inter batch
Is the IoT thing groupwise ??
labs and project are
Literally said no
💀💀
oh wait shit i thought they mean teams sorry
Cool cool
From what I've heard we must conduct the selection ourselves
4 ppl represent the batch
So we"ll prolly hold a lichess event and top 4 get selected
i mean don't they have to provide info regarding who all registered etc
Alr i just asked a ug2 senior to see how they doing it. But i presumed we'd like create a WhatsApp grp regarding the selections  and those who registered wld join the whats app group
Any update on whether we'll continue doing dsa in python or change?
Asked a TA he said they've been instructed to teach in Python for now
Ya he replied saying we cld do it that way, so one of us wld need to create a grp for this soon
What about the poll then?
Do u think these guys will change the language just because the majority wants that
u may never know, there's no wrong in trying too.(depends on their mood)
Why did they change to python
Cause in C you have to write everything from scratch...python has some shortcuts
Python very cool language
I am just asking. Ta's are instructed we know that too. But they must have done the poll after thinking something na
😶
🙃
C++ also does
So why not C++
python is a more widely used language and it is in general important to know python ig. Thus this is a way of making us more comfortable and learn python better.
Dude you touched python for 10 minutes and decided you didn't like it
Yesss
I didn't say I don't like
I said c++ is much more convenient
With all the data structures and stl
Same point, u haven't even tried python yet
Did
It's good only I'm not saying it's bad
Lite then
Also anyways we r learning python in iss, so why again?
I'm ok with anything
Ofc u r
Just prefer c++
why is python preferred by the python voters though
Idk why just went on vibes
🙄
it is in general more widely used for lot of purposes, so better if you get more comfortable with it.
but this stands
ya, but more practice the better. Acc to me, it won't make much of a diff if you use python or c++. But c will be much more of a headache than these two
Language doesn't matter, get hold of core concepts and you can learn as many languages as you want
In c we need to create all the data structures from scratch
That's one problem cuz it's a low level language
major pain point is not having something like dynamic arrays(lists in python or vectors in cpp)
Ya
True for dsa as long as u can get the pseudo code and algo correct, ig lang doesn't matter
It's just a matter of conveniencr
language matters for lab exams
paper exams lite pseudo works
So you're saying I can speak any language? Waow
not in lab tho
For labs yes
yes but in c , ull break ur head more about unwanted stuff than the dsa concepts many times, so python or c++ will be better in those aspects
that’s 40% of our grade bro 😭
Yup
I never said c is better tho
It matters, but everyone's gonna have the same time and same amount of code to write
C is the worst choice for dsa
Imo
So, if it's relative grading, I don't think language matters a lot unless you have a hold of core concepts.
Who the fuck is talking abt c
Irrelevant ahh language
So the current majority is cpp but again does it depend on the prof?
Our snrs apparently had in cpp
And also it's the industry standard
Ofc java has more pref for dsa
no they had in c
acc to what TAs told in tdy's tut, Chopella will keep it in python only mostly and it is doubtfull that he will change anything in his plan
Did they?
I think it was c and then a gradual shift to cpp
Idk
I remember soumil saying dsa is taught in c
Ohh
learning how to implement a hash map is not "unwanted stuff ull break ur head about"
but ok
the entire point of dsa is to learn how to implement the data structures, so why use a language that has the data structures built in 😭
Advait built different
also, c++ sounds more cool than python
Episode 2:  A bulb simply exploded in the new dining area in the guest house just before dinner timings n there was like, smoke and shattered glass everywhere. Luckily very few students(including me) were present at the time of the incident. At this point Kadamb's just unlucky lmao @MPs since eating in the old guest house, now Kadamb mess is gonna be a regular thing, could someone mail the college to TRY to run some maintainence checks or smthn?

Why are you trying to edit Wikipedia in the first place haaris?
Dude I'm a part time Wikipedia editor
I regularly edit football and electronic music pages on Wikipedia
Imagine doing something that benefits a community and being useful
Ooh damn
Thanks
I know right :(
That was a compliment
Oh
Thank yoy
Should I add frog found in Biriyani to IIIT-H Wikipedia page
Harris become mp
Haaris I think you just answered your question as to why we can't edit Wikipedia on iiith wifi
yes
💀💀
Actually
Student student dating itself isnt allowed
student student talking barely allowed
let him edit his eastern europe t3 football club stats 🙏
_first year_
??
Thank you Siddarth
Bruv
Faculty will have massive consequences bcoz of the power imbalance and them being in a much more position of power and the student might get something ig?
Depends on the genders too considering this is VIT
Holy cow some of the iot lab team names are wild
Immature baccha hai
Chutiya bhi hai
It being legal is one thing, it being hella creepy is another
Thats what excessive 🌽  does to someone
Fucking hell eyes blinded by lust and no sense of responsibility and morality
FFS
i mean have you seen shomu
Peak haram tbh
don’t lie to yourself
💀💀
balls
the closet is made of glass
GURUJI 🔥🔥🔥
Ur team is wild

iot lab team 3244🔥🔥🔥🔥
10+ cg confirmed
Share here for the ppl who don't have iot ^^
Making average cg tend to infinity
nope
Damn it's crazy the way i can't remember asking you
(Feena my chocolate 😭)
come 101
Rn?
Sure
Am mess ;-;
Wait like
15 mins
I have lab re
Come after 5
Oh 😭
Ok :>
fire? did you mean hearts and kisses
rachit not me
bday pe bhi bechaara
India is not for beginners
Also over anything else what if the faculty threatens to fail you if you withdraw consent or try to break up
Lol
💀
null
Wonderful censoring, join decore 👍
Last one 😭😭😭😭
This one is crazy
Nooo💀💀
I mean that's a thing with any relationship
There will always be power imbalances to consider
Its a lot more different here bcoz the faculty fucker has a lot more power over you
Its not a ridiculous imbalance like in a standard student-student relationship
Damn bro if u don't like me just say so
Ye but that's not necessarily _the thing_ that makes this kind of relationship a bad idea
Op team name
Imagine like mp-student it's similar (also pls imagine that mps have any power)
hey guys you know what club you should join if you wanna argue haha
Oh my god
Yeah I mean its just an annotation I wanted to add
In dreams odmf mps powers
Fair enough
Its by far not the worst thing
Don't let ponnam become an mp
The age gap and each party's intentions are arguably more concerning
Exactly
This is what happens when your brain is loaded with immaturity and horny
What the fuck
Why the fuck would you enter into such a fucked relationship despite being FUCKING MARRIED YA SICK CUNT

No reason given at all

Can someone summarise the new dsa grading scheme
labs have less weightage, lab exams have more, best 8 out of 11 labs will be considered, last jan lab and all after that will be graded
also the assignment schedule is on moodle
Yo can you ask them to reduce endsem lab weightage💀
It's 25 wtf that's deadly😭
Gsc endsem is 45% 🥰
weightages are upto them lol we cant say much
cobfatst
-_-
What
Not in GSC though
We can ask for +-10% change
What is gsc ???
gender sensitisation committee
definitely will
Fair enough
H2 course :)
For everyone :))
Man only if endsem goes badly though
If endsem goes rlly well having that high weightage is a good thing
Have you ever wanted to learn a new language? But feel too choked in the academic schedule to pick it up yourself? Well, guess what?! The Language Club is organising two weekly events to help you pick up a new language this sem! Do you want to learn German or Spoken Telugu? TLC has got you covered!

The teachers are AMAZING! Personal guarantee. Plej join if interested :))

I ❤️ python and I shall 🔫 anyone who complains against Lord Chopella 😇 who shows the world peace and prosperity of 🐍
fuck you 1/10/25, 1:40 PM - Hemang: Draco malfoy
(why do i feel like I started a civil war)
Nah bro has angered guruji himself sentence orbi8r to balls electrocution
Because you literally did
Who tf uses a slow language (actually used for other stuffs) for dsa
Python is great But for machine learning algos Cpp is better for dsa
it doesn't matter if it's slow, DSA questions ain't that big. and it's the faculties headache to correct our code.  for us fast coding = more chance of finishing exam on time
Then whats issue with cpp
With stls and all it wud be easier
we need to write a lot more code
Just only definations and nothing else
No point discussing the pros and cons. Instructors have finalised Python. Focus on learning now
Ok mp sir
Tbf I like python more but chopella is making python  difficult even tho I already know the language
Ok saar
Typical iiit experience
can't argue, given I didn't listen his yappery last session
Btw whats gonna happen in today's lab? What are the topics?
Thanks Joshua Sir.
python
I was genuinely wondering if he was teaching python or some other random shit
Merge and selection
Ohh kk
Bruh
do we need to bring our laptops?
ppls please bombard chopella with all the doubts you have today
even the dumbest doubts
I didnt
because it'll let him know that we dont know python and he better teach us properly
anything u say, can and will be used against u in the court of law (and ima show this plotting evidence to Lord Chopella)
Heh
Sir why it is called python not boa😡
How dare u threaten guruji orbi8r
Monty Boa sounds funny lmao
Nah sankalp kassiing even the lore behind python
rdr mentioned 🔥🔥
Seeing guruji chat in whatsapp while I can see him irl is such a blessing fr
अजगर for real
Wat no way monty python is where python came from I'll cry
It is
Lmao
First csc class of 11th was crazy

Wonderful
Good morning
Lmao in class she was like "chopella is talented" or sum shit
No lmao
no ma
Oh yeah he's just rlly confident in himself 1/10/25, 3:05 PM - Hemang: yeah he is he has a phd in yappology
she's extremely professional so you cant expect her to go insulting her co faculty, whether she likes them or not
She was like "He knows what he is doing, so we just let him"
Section B people imagine finally being in sh1 but w him ... ur lives can't get nice at all
Enough that he convinced fhe ofher profs to let him do whatever
Also this
And then sniggered in the corner
ikr
Gang i think choppella is actively fucking up my minesweeper games
His very presence
how dare he
Is making my internet slow
True, must be painful to have to glaze ur random ahh coworker
:(
so not even the profs like choppella and python for dsa ryt @mps
Why do u need internet for minesweeper
Evidently (shows their competence and his lack thereof)
Bro how the fuck does he have this much power 💀
Minesweeper online
WHAT DID I JUST HEAR HIM SAY
WHO DID HE TAME WTF
💀💀💀
What did he say ?
He said "I have tamed them" or something along those lines
But idk the context
💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Someone help
I think he halfway succeeded in trying to become Saitama, his hairline is a testament to that
Section B gets the short end of the stick every single time 😭
I don't think any context can justify this
bro i feel even the tas are pissed atp
He tamed While loops apparently
judging from their expressions
wil we have any assignment today
And he says that he doesn't hate or love anything on earth
or is this like a guest lecture type shit
Sad existence
He's literally an npc what
13th
Oh he's the lab prof btw
We'll have lab after this
For dsa
There is an assignment after this
What kinda fetish is this
WHAT THE FUCK
I thought it was just today?
Check moodle ...everything is uploaded
Chi wtf
abhi se kar sakte hai kya
And just
Leave the lab
Just the first few
Assignment dates, lab dates, tut weeks and shit
some dude took his bag and left it was so goofy
Evthng moodle par kar fiya
No for the next mpnth he's teaching python
"Teaching"
I thought it was a new language lmao
So as long as labs are ungrade you'll have to deal with this
I am forgetting all that I learnt in school 💀
can they just give us a course or smn I'd rather do that than sit here
Hemang did lmao
Supposedly his other courses are damn good
No idea why he's taking this
No :)
He's good at what he does no doubt
And the thing is
i highly doubt the sanity of any person that calls his courses good
yapping?
Tf you mean no doubt Yes doubt Very doubt
Nah I actually have doubts
The moment what he's teaching clicks it _clicks_
He does compilers courses iirc
Grp 6 ppl were roasting choppela in the official DSA grp 6 grp . The TA got pissed at us and changed the grp setting to admins only 😭
if you mean going on a power trip and yapping yes
Except he's just yapping rn
LMFAO
What exactly js going on
Shut him up someone
Why
How to get 0 in lab exam speedrun
Tas don't want to lose their salary
Yeaj
The only thing clicking is the trigger on the gun against my forehead
He used to be compilers prof
Pocket money u meant??
i’ve never seen vedant talk this much during a class wtf is choppella doing
And the blore party from the intro story frfr
What is he talking about lmfao
Delete that shit
Guys this is actually genius
If even guruji has no idea tf is going on then u r a failure of a teacher
💀💀
I'll be honest the only reason is that the chat isn't interesting enough 💀
Yeahh they said it's not possible to connect
💀💀💀
Lord Choppella cooking 🔥🔥
If the chat is interesting enough vedant will also yap lmao
They spared you👍
Dude stop that joke is getting old
In the next 1.5 hrs (3.30-5) you will have to do a problemset based on this so all doubts will anyways become clear  dw   Sent by a TA
Cooked fr
Nice "Technical" Institute lmao
You escaped honestly
Wait   Wait WHAT
Yea☠️
Gm josh
Technical institute ❎ Technical issues ✅
wait what thats not right I'll talk to them wait
now u need me?
can confirm
Vedant is above us mere mortals
Yeah that's honestly fucked tho He's literally in a teams meeting anyway
Why do you want to torture her
Guruji I thought u were supposed to help students
fair point lasya do you _really_ want to endure this
Thanks.. But it's okay..
I don't😂
The batch says its a bad idea 😂
I'm grateful 😂
now i know you are not merely intelligent but also extremely smart 😂
@917679041770 looking at u
how
Real
What the actual hell is this guy doing?, bro's finding maximum numbers using statemachines 😭
how are you not being sarcastic
why 😭
Lmao
Guys what the fuck is going on
You are paying attention @919663360173 ?
Are yall okay?
😂😂 thank you..
no
no
~Common enemy?¿~
YES HE CHOPPED MY SANITY IN HALG
"The class is finishing in a few minutes" best shit I've heard all my life
Hah nice one
Trying to
What are you all talking about.. Isn't the class about basic python
Definitely
(would not recommend)
He'll understand even if he pays attention for one second every minute 💀👍
All I understood is that he's making some state machine
i have no clue what he is going on about
What the fuck is a state machine
peak 🔥
Tf😂
His "Basic" python
Hopping from state to state based on a function
I hope to God its the DSM one
Ya ya
same shit
Holy fuck what is this different level of kassi, willing to put himself thru this grueling torture
just in code
It's neither basic nor python... Nor relevant... Nor coherent
fr
guys just wait till 3:30 let’s hope it gets over by then 😭
Mealy and Moore Now those were the good days
Fr fr
+1
I pray for you all
He's doing what
I'm pretty sure it's ds
What is going on in your class
Bullshit
Culling
YAY CLASS OVER
Only the strong survive
YES
The weak die
can anyone tell me what name he said for the machine he made??
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
FINALLY
Avg mp providing moral support to the batch
Sir hit us with the "welcome to oop"
I'm guessing he made a Turing machine
It is what it is?
AND THIS SHIT AINT GRADED FUCK IT ALL
Or he explained it
DS💀
Transition+states+machine makes me feel that's what he's intending to say
Fuck it. It's ungraded, thus irrelevant
iiit mindset
top 3 cs college in india🔥🔥
I asked him, its called discrete flow machine
Crazy shit
🔥🔥🔥
Bro conned me, was like yeah, its a kind of state machine called discrete flow machine
Idk what he taught 🫠
Wow chopella teaching chemistry even tho he has absolutely no reason to
LMFAOOO
wtf is going on in ur lab guys
💀
Can someone explain what were supposed to do
@917745090290 , u got any idea what to do?
Like what is the question
switch college
Is there a question
Does anyone know anything
Real
eat 5star do nothing
yeah 😭
Bro💀
Nah drop out and sell pani puri you'll make bank
I came here to ask the exact same question
coming back as megathon stall to groom facchas
I'm just told to check moodle for submission
What function are we supposed to modify? There are a lot of programs in the zip file they sent
WTF IS THIS EMOJI 😭
The fuck we got attendance machines in lab before gta6
apparently we have to implement bubble sort or something
🤫🧏
in those selsort files
but the tas themselves dont know how to lmao
There's a bunch of python code in those sensors files tf
Brother no one knows
Can I just delete all the files in the zip and write bubble sort code
Damn what
If anyone knows, please tell
Wtf is this code lmao
Gave us impossible to read code smh
the tas asked the same question to the prof it seems lmaooo
"chopped"
rip
😂😂
New language with extension .chop 🔥🥵
.chop
zesty main(){
should've just gone w c 😡🔥
}
Fuck even this guy has no idea wallhi we're finished
Also has the submission got anything to do with hemachandra-Fibonacci series?
doesn't the hemachandra fibonaccis series also have some 7 questions
Should we do that
i was gonna ask too 💀 there's so many questions idk where and how to implement that
Who's hemachandra and why is he here
“Chopped!”
nahi nahi
I was joking all this time about him teaching ds instead of python but I'm going thru this pdf and it's actual ds what the fuck
can we use normal bubble sort
so we just have to change selsort function in selsort.py ?
to bubble sort
coz wtf is this selsort pdf 😭
You know what? Go ahead this shit ain't graded
Who the fuck hired this mf
ikr what is that code
show
I have no idea. After the Telugu singer named hemachandra, the only place I saw hemachandra is the lab sheet document on Moodle
He takes half of our lab time to "teach" some random shit that has absolutely nothing to do with what we're actually learning in dsa and then the he gives us the remaining measly time left to operate on whatever bs he's given us
Why tf are we being taught functional programming in DSA😭
No one does this shit in the real world.
🥲
@everyone who ran away they're taking biometric attendance in the labs please come back quickly
Any new info about what to do?
best IT kalej saaar 1/10/25, 3:57 PM - Hemang: ???? 1/10/25, 3:57 PM - Hemang: fr?
Frfr
we're supposed to implement bubble sort using the zip file code given
that code implements select sort
we have to change it
Oh also no using loops :) they don't want interative implementation
They want functional implementation so no loops
Ya, its functional programming, loops not allowed 😭
Only functions
And the functions also can't have loops :)
مادرچود چوپلا بھےنچود
Fucker weren't u just showing ur smug ass abt how c is better or sum shit bcoz of this whole scenario
What are the consequences of not submitting?
Sem 1 Lab=understandable Class=not Sem 2 Swap(class, lab)
bro fr
its ungraded right
Frrrrr
can we give course feedback before the course ends
@mps
lini was talking about something like that in class
Clg preparing the UG1 guys for ICPC finals via lab
R they mossing this
Lini best fr
How can we tho
Even girish asked us to fill not once but twice It was an anonymous form too. Though girish was good. Little did I know...
Tf?
What happen
Oh you poor innocent sweet summer child
Just saw the zip file dawg wtf
#BringBackGirish
Nah fuck off
TA said everything wud be fixed by 3rd week
Thats when lini will takeover
#FuckIIITNotMe
R they gonna moss
Someone tell no
💀😭
Dawg isnt this ungraded
Bro
Huh
Ungraded hei bhai
No way man
What the ruck
Is this really the reaction you're giving
Not my genuine reaction but I feel devious today
Never making the mistake of even noticing girish ever
Lini will have a feedback form up soon (~a week)
Get lost
Dawg chill on me im just joking 😭😭😭
Oh ok good
Its a criminal offence to use the word girish for good things
Yeah Lini seems to be the abhishek of dsa
Very for the students
......will kshitij be the Girish
No idts actually
common attribute: Both r from IIIT itself
Lini is frm IIIT whaaaa
ya
Chopped! is the Girish then 😔
How long do we have to endure the chopped
Idts
Dw, by the time he finished, he would have successfully chopped you into  abstraction.
What is the submission format for the lab doc?
There is a lab doc??
i meant the  zip file  which were given
Oh
2nd time
💀
💀💀💀
We cooked
Do we need to submit the entire zip file? Or just the modified files
entire zip
One file for fibonacci, one file for bubblesort and put both those folders in one zipped folder
:0 what the
Not two zipped files?
What about the IoT lab report?
No
Whole zipped folder, no?
How will those two files work on their own?
Though, submit any, either whole folder or those two files, I think it should not be an issue
I submitted the entire folder
Same here
Damn they even give refund
but whatever lord chopped taught us today, is important for gamedev, and is a popular style of writing clean code. so 8/10 syllabus.
As for how well he taught it. Just admit it guys, yall had laptops open and didn't even listen to him. He did go over all the logic and code line by line
Guys I don't think he's being sarcastic
yea 😐, unbiased I listened to the class
But it is not data structures and algorithms.  This is like false advertising. Saying that ull teach DSA and finally teach Functional programming.
I didn't listen coz I didn't feel like learning ds again
True, he went too much industry heavy.  but that doesn't mean python is not a very good language for DSA
atleast 'learning' and writing 'exam' part
see this is when a mass batch email spam is needed
This isn't about python, it's about how much what he's teaching deviates from what we are actually learning in dsa
language is a moot point now that he's not even teaching dsa lmao
not really, we will need this style of coding to understand some stuff
Yes dsa can be learnt in any language. Im not complaining Abt that.  I actually prefer python itself.
but its completely irrelevant to anything in DSA
He's just teaching his own shit
he should teach the course hes supposed to teach
not what he wants to teach
There is a dedicated course for this ig.
First of all, the purpose of labs is to apply what we have learnt in class
yeah
This guy is taking his own classes at the expense of doing actual lab time
agreed, theres a complete disconnect between whats being done in class
and what he chooses to teach
And then we're supposed to do it on the spot
In 2 fucking hours
the whole point of DSA is taking a basic algorithm and using it in various contexts for solving different problems
Guys guys, If we don't look at DSA without understanding State machienes. We will develop a bad way of writing code.  For a company, this skill is very useful to maintain a code and update it. this class was important and relevant to DSA
in this its taking various problems and using it to create a basic algorith
m
Given that extensions will decrease our grade, this is even more bs
not even 2, the tas themselves got to know what we have to do at around 415 lab officially ends at 5
Ohh kk
the thing is not everyone wants to do software engineering im sure ece+other research branches
Its like telling we need to learn system design first then move our heads to learn oops
sir ppl dont know how to read python syntax you are trying to teach an illiterate person shakespeare
Yeah, even the fucking tas have no idea what's going on, how can we be expected to do this shit
Then that's the problem, so tell sir to give us more basic practice problems as "hw" assignments
I know it's ungraded but why does the due time say 530 and not 10/1030 like sir was saying??
Even if it is important, overloading us with it from the get go and deviating from our actual dsa syllabus is a huge no no
because its an unofficial extension and you can still upload till 1030
then whats the point of the lab
Okay cool
lini ma'am said the labs will mirror the lectures this bs is absolutely not what labs are for
i didn't attend the lab obv but i saw the line "from loop import loop" and thats the craziest thing ive ever seen
It's like we're just learning a separate topic apart from dsa
we are
But all things apart the ideology insanely cool
The class was relevant and important, but it should have been a part of the Cpro course rather than DSA
but wrong course
Probably this is only fr around first few labs only.  After that it'll be dsa itself mostly ig
its kind of like Abhishek teaching topology in RA
he wasn't supposed to
wrong course bru
and it was definetly very cool
but its the wrong course
Ik t_t
I like how he covered up by saying
Wrong institute
I and X are data structures
Bro only got a few labs, and it's ungraded, so ig where chopped is coming from.  But yea it is unfair to those who don't know basics of python
Btw @919941637224 what did you ask him
bro understanding state machines and doing functional programming prolly have entire courses dedicated to them in the future...why are we doing this in dsa??
Yahan CPro mein DSA tha, aur ab DSA mein Cpro and ISS h, all courses getting mixed
Ok and? It still doesn't explain or excuse why he's doing all this shit
which is _most_ of the batch
He should have taught that in CMI or something, 
forget basics of python it feels completely arbitrary  also isn't the next sem course automata theory literally for teaching finite state machines?
you cant think of yourself only ffs
real
fair
Did this guy accidentally enter the wrong class or sumtin? Like goddamn
ikr 😭
Most retarded shit I've seen since girish
Shantav?
shantanav
course profs are lini thomas and kshitig gajjar right.....where did venkatesh choppella come from?
I know, it was a joke (sort of)
oh
Lab prof
From the deepest pits of hell
New experiment 👀
he is the lab prof  like sandeep nagar for cpro
oh dang
i cant believe i miss Sandeep nagar
what are you cooking in the lab
IFKR LMAO
multifile programming 💀
much better than this btw
can we collectively do something against this? I mean if every single person in the batch has a problem with a prof, can absolutely nothing be done?
Basic reality altering machine
college will ghost again 🥰
@917745090290, enlighten them
💀 what? I was trying to figure out what functional programming was lmao
He is a powerful guy
But i think it's better to wait
Ah fuck as if this ain't the most ominous shit I've heard
we have requested a feedback form if and when it comes, we want you to all to complain about the labs, *NOT* about python vs c vs cpp
Same thing
please pin this
Probably it'll be normal after 2-3 labs
We are cooked...
ill post on announcements when it comes
It will be (a ta said)
why do you think so
chopella said he wants to continue this when i asked him
Bruh
aren't tas themselves fed up due to this?
Damn
We're chopella's guinea pigs
Istg if some mf complains abt python and ruins our complaining I will rip of their genitals and feed it to the crows (I'm looking at you @919849233901 )
he said you can follow whatever method but he will expect it to be like this
2 tas literally quit coz of this shit
i asked the a TA and he said it will follow choppella's format...but he itself was very unsure so idkkk
what?
who
OSN is gonna fuck us lmao
Idk, I've just heard abt it
his courses he teaches fine
thats not an issue
no idea why he decided to teach this
yea
more than 2 iirc
It's his topic.
wdym quit?
"WELcOMe tO iiItH" or sum shit
It's what his elective course is
He wants to impose it on everyone
i know he teaches functional programming why here though 😭
crazy
veryy bad marketing strategy
his courses are POPL and Compilers i think
Like they didn't want to deal with this bs and quit coz even the tas had no idea what this guy was on
Yes, this comes in popl
ah interesting
Apparently he wanted the tas to convert his entire ass fucking code into c just so that he could show that "the language doesn't matter" or sum stupid ass shit
Bro idc which lang they teach
real id even do brainfk
Choppella taught bad tdy
Bitch in today's lab you literally turned around and told me some shit along the lines of "see this is the python u wanted"
I said, am saying and will say that I'm ok with python, but I prefer cpp
I have no problems with dsa in python
Just a personal preference on cpp
For all the "I'm ok with python" you spout all the time you seem to have an incredibly strong aversion to and hate for python
Whatever u think of it bro
It's not whatever I think of it, you keep finding a reason to shit on python, move on lil bro
I literally said I have no problems with python
the main problem is chopped
Then I do not want to hear another peep out of you complaining abt python

It's 3 questions brother 💀
💀💀💀
literally but my answers are so damn short that i'm kinda concerned
Btw guys, Programming Club is conducting LockOut which is basically a 1v1 CP duel.  So for one round, there would basically be a bunch of problems picked with different points for each of them and the two players race to solve them. Say one of them solves a problem, he gets the points for that problem and it gets locked for others. So the other player is screwed even if they are like one minute away from solving it. So yeah, it is really fun lmao(or maybe not if you are in the receiving end 💀). Lot of strategy involved on how to screw over your opponent. There is a separate track for UG1, so ez W. Insane flex fr. Some of the later rounds _may_ even be streamed with commentary.

Its called breathing exercises
Mate wot
~This old guy, 2025 1/11/25, 1:19 PM - Manan: If someone is sitting in the seminar can they tell if there is going to be an attendance
Come near h105

Now only 1/11/25, 1:22 PM - Manan: Can I get there in time
wdym free attendance bro we alr put
you can’t get extra attendance 😭
Its also called playing classical music around campus before and after classes
Yes I g
Sports?
Arts
it's called being told that you'll get hit directly on your nose (when you already have a deviated septum lol)
😭😭😭😭
That person was TARGETING me 😭😭
after that the other side it was me lol
😭
Not a bad idea
Doubt it'll ever get implemented
icl i wouldn’t want ANY music being played around campus
classical or not
Huh
Exactly
Wasn't yesterday's underground on campus
If anyone has any videos from underground can y’all share??
Guys
Uk how lini calls people by shirt colors right
So can we all coordinate as a batch, and wear the same color one day
It'll be hilarious af
💀why
Or even better, everyone just wears felicity shirts
What did Lini do to you? 💀
Damn nikhilesh cooking
Broo it would be so funny
No shit
We should actually do this
Yess
Joshua gets it
🤜🤛
Easiest to do it the day after felicity tbh
Also would be easier to brush off as a coincidence
Nice event
lmfaooooooo
Even guruji agrees with this plan, there's no reason to not want to do it
💀💀💀
yes
lets do it
everyone wear black or something 😂😂
These 2 are there
give it a week till when people wash if they r used🙏
What abt pant colour? She might start using those colors instead
black
Okay then
Classic Jeans
don't wear any pants josh
or jeans
💀💀
Yeaassss
💀
Let’s wear felicity shirts
This ain't the place to display your fetishes
May be in the next class ?
Na all don't have them
Megatron
we don't talk anymore😔
Let’s wear white or black then?
...yu don't have to wear the same t  shirt ra just wear anything that is black💀
Balck is better bcz people can wear megathon t shirts alo
She might call us based on the things written 😭 but still it’s fine
Ok all megathon sit on side and. Felicity on other side
lmaooo
Ig yea that’s good
Announce kardijiye guruji 😂😂
Announcements group mein
Yesss
@mps pls confirm
😂😂😂
damn nice idea 😭
felicity black tshirt is best for this
I agree black > white

Guys, this is a reminder for all those who are interested, the German event is slated to begin today at 3 p.m. at H204, while the Telugu event is scheduled for 9 p.m. at H104
@MPs we said C++ not python
NOT C NOT PYTHON
😭😭
it got deleted lite
💀
Better than python atleast na💀
waitt whattt ??
Actually
c is better
C++
as long as it isn't python-
what happened
C++ is better
osn is 4k lines of code in c
Seniors had to BEG to gujjar for C++ 1/12/25, 10:51 AM - Krrish Gupta: Bhai python se better toh C hi hai na
c better
But with that, you can't learn to create data structures
Lmaooo
What the fuck
Why would you agree to this
These guys are crazy
Watch them change their mind a week later
so what about labs being in python and ungraded?
Istg
bro is the clg insane
Real
now next week it will be rust
Will these 4 weeks be python or C
Why C
It's too tough to manage data structures
And the next will be java lol
And then javascript
HTML
dont forget css
yes yes, data structures using html
Better than python tho
Profs be like Why can't u do dsa in css
ppls i really think this change is good
and i don't think the profs are goign to change it erlang
so chill about that
Anyways our seniors too had it in c
the labs will no longer be the mess that they were on friday
change from C to python or python to C?
So it's fair
do we still have to do functional programming or can we do normal programming
normal programming
thx
dont think they'll do that
Yeah until they had to beg for C++ 1/12/25, 10:58 AM - Kartik: Thanks to all the mps tho👍🏻
uhh which change former to latter or the other way
see the seniors had their labs in c, and towards the end for the difficult part with graphs and all, they let them use cpp
so we can ask for the same
My salute for those 26 members who selected python
vedant so the conclusion is there is no other lang only c like last years right no confusion between c c++ python right
Changed to C
they are shifting back to C is what the prof told us so no i dont think they'll change it 1/12/25, 11:00 AM - Eashaan Thakur: 😯
So we will have to write code for maps, linked lists and stacks from scratch now
Anyways tq mps
@917483618341 lmao
Next step Dsa on bash
Thank god, fuck functional programming
No offense @917483618341
The students: Can we please have C++ instead of Python uwu
Let's C another batch bite the dust
DSA is going to be much harder if we have to do it in C, please go with python or C++ @mps
Why did you guys agree on C anyways @mps? Didn't the poll clearly say that the second most preferred option was Python?
yes exactly^^
While I understand that you couldn't have held another referendum to see if people wanted C or Python, the least you could have done is base your decisions off the previous one? What is the reasoning behind choosing C?
Most colleges these days don't even have a "C Pro" course, let alone teach DSA in C
which colleges are you referring to lmao
we didn't choose lol its mighty presumptious of you to assume we waltzed into someone's office and chose C
Check out MITs lecs  And apparently Princeton did it in Java? Am I not right @917075970819 ? Or closer home, colleges like VIT (with whom we are sadly compared with) do follow the same
You didn't choose, but your message sounds like we ought to be happy with this turn of events
And that you guys aren't going to push against C
so you want to do it in java? be my guest, walk into the deans office and demand it lmao
Yeah
The batch wanted C++ not C
The batch wanted it in C++ lmao Or if nothing, then Py
Certainly not C 💀
should have gone to vit 😔
The batch does not want to C C
Don't drag me into this -_-
Ikr, that was my very next option 💀
i am well aware what the batch wanted
its not that we can go and enforce it
what makes you think that??
@919941637224 1/12/25, 11:18 AM - Krrish Gupta: bro wtf is wrong with you. its clearly not in their hands what the profs choose. they sent a large ass mail to use cpp/c and chops still chose python only no. clearly all they can do is just send mail
So you guys are? Yay? Lesgo
This says that you are trying to look for a C/C++ mixture, not C++ or Python as was the initial plan
No it's not
Its not in their hands to choose*
theres a reason dsa is in c in iiith since so many years u learn to create each data structure from scratch and youll be having osn next sem which is 5k lines of code purely in c so better not crib 1/12/25, 11:20 AM - Krrish Gupta: lol complaining about learning dsa in c is stupid
thats exactly what your and adityas messages are implying
ikr
Yes but please push back against it changing to C
no
i myself have busted my ass for this
I was trying to say that you guys should have tried to push for x not C But if that isn't going to happen, what am I to say?
i am not fucking doing this until every single person in this batch personally comes up to me and tells me this
We're saying you shouldn't be content with C instead of C++ bc it's worse than both python and C++ 1/12/25, 11:22 AM - Krrish Gupta: wait do you want python?
Guys i think the mps have done the most they can w regard to this
If we annoy the profs too much they won’t be inclined to listen to us
No shit lmao
bruh r u guys mad do u really want to create a joke out of urselves in front of the prof like ra last sem first u pushed from python to c c++ when they denied mps put the most effort to get it to c do u really want c avg in dsa also or wht
i did say we will push for cpp but that comes later
They’ve been sent the poll, they know cpp is the majority’s choice
god you ppl have no tact or what
either that or C++
you cant demand stuff like this
If they are vehement about either c or python then it makes sense to go ask again
you're literally the POC
Not continuously pester
who else do we contact
Makes sense
Esp considering that everything seems to be in a deciding phase rn
i am not saying dont contact me
im saying think a little please 😭
DSA hi hata do DS 2 laga do😀😀😀
imagine shooting oneself on the foot 💀   DSA being difficult 💀, Plus adding C to that 💀💀
what does that mean
Srinathan supremacy
@917745090290 lite le kuch mat kar python se c kradia enough
isse zyada kya krega 1/12/25, 11:24 AM - Ayush: Python better if the goal of our DSA syllabus is to write accurate pseudocode and understand abstractions 1/12/25, 11:25 AM - Ayush: If simple implementation is needed then C or C++ but the prof has been dishing out concept after concept in python anyways
1. we mps did not _choose_ anything; we made our case for cpp, they said no outright. after the disastrous lab, we asked what the heck and they said ok we'll make it c. now we have the intent to push for cpp later.
Bro if the college only thought python is lite we could have kept that no C trauma is retarded FUCK CPRO
oh wait wrong tag
nvm 1/12/25, 11:26 AM - Krrish Gupta: i think initially learning DSA in C is a better choice. sure we can switch to cpp later on in the course, but atleast in the beginning we will understand everything whats happening under the hood. and if you are worried about writing extra code in labs, then they can still provide pre-written code in labs and we just have to use those functions to implement the data structure.
ikr 😭
AYYYY KANNAN SAR MENTIONED WEEEWOOO😡😡😡🔥🔥🔥🔥 (kannan4lyf) 1/12/25, 11:26 AM - Ayush: We needed C to understand low level, not to take memory for granted
concept after concept matlab are you talking about the lab stuff? 1/12/25, 11:26 AM - Manan: Guys right now we should just take C later down the sem we will ~beg~ ask the professor for CPP
that wont be there anyways now 1/12/25, 11:27 AM - Ayush: Especially friday lab
haa that we argued against, its not going to be like that anymore
normal labs hoge like last year's dsa 1/12/25, 11:27 AM - Manan: Germany acquiring Rhineland before WW2 type shi 1/12/25, 11:27 AM - Ayush: I'm not in the groups anyways but reading 104 paged document to write bubble sort mathematically is insane
that is what we intend to do
Bhai how many times are we gonna mail proffs and ask them change their decision lol? Proffs hai vo . We shldnt annoy them much Varna laga denge in exams and all
@917337295535 this is what i meant by think
they're profs at the end of day you cant demand stuff
they are gonna do that anyways da
anyways if they wanna sock us they'll sock us might as well piss them off FUCK GIRISH😡😡😡😡😡
switch iiit for bits atp wat even is this college😭
bro u demanded c++ you can still request for c++ oor python instead of C
like I understand you don't want to pester them
but you asking is why this chanfe came about in the first place
all I'm asking is that you politely request (not demand) that they reconsider
we did not demand anything we requested for c/cpp we got outright rejected  they conducted a shitty lab we complained they said we'll switch back to c lini ma'am is looking at the labs now we'll push for cpp later
we wanted c++ > python > c no for c python only would have been better no😭😭
C/C++?
why c/cpp?
batch wanted C++ oonly
The way the lab was conducted could have been changed but why was the language changed from python to c
we actually said cpp in the mail, but we said later that c would be fine to the profs
yeah
Uhh?
after consulting whom??
WHYYYYYY😭 Guruji why😭 Why C😭
isn't c++ extremely easy if you alr know C? better na
i don't think we ever agreed to this
as a batch
😭cpro endsems reduced my cg by 1 number best of luck da
Why?? What was the problem with python?? If we were not getting cpp
the labs were the problem
were you in fridays lab??
that was a temporary thing, ungraded.  Overall the course would have been easier with Python
you shouldn't be making decisions on behalf of the batch without asking everyone first
let me tell you that was not temporary
u wish it was temporary
that style of writing code was temporary
c*
You mean C right? Or am I missing something?
no it was not chopella wanted it for the entire course
yes i meant c sorry
ok but my point still stands you didn't ask the batch
This couldn't be the excuse there could be other ways to conduct labs just for labs sake u couldn't compromise with the whole course
kulkarni escape varna 1 ghanta justification hi deta rahega
this was a decision that was taken by the senior parliament members and the TAs
Yeah Vedant, not like we can do much now anyways
As far as I heard from people and tas, it is good to implement data structures in c while dsa is good to do in cpp
there was not
Yeah should have conducted the poll
Let's C how many of us sit with our juniors in the future though 😂💀
True, and the lab wasn't even that bad. If we listened to what Choppella yapped about as "theory"
Bhai pls stop this rant on c
C is a base
I believe they’ll end up w a balance of using both a little bit
We can extend it to cpp
This is a good idea
we didnt make the decision to say ok to C, seniors and tas did that we couldnt really oppose them
mail spam🥹🥹
But for now they’re saying c to shut everybody up for a bit while they decide maybe
and that base is complex. so either we Focus on base and format or DSA knowledge
c++=c+easier implemneation of graphs thats it lite
im also sick and tired of listening to 4 ppl claiming to speak for the entire batch because oh so sad their favourite language is no longer being used
The whole point was for that base and format to be learnt last semester in a course fully centred around the language
and graphs is the 2nd last topic so doesnt make a diff till then
it's pretty difficult to write logic stressfree when u have to deal with pointers and memory alloc and all everywhere
this is the decision, live with it
You don’t seem to understand that python is NOT the dsa standard
hate me for it, blame me for it, i literally could not care less
Real shit
lite it seems nigga cpro didn't fuck u over uh😭
Yes I get it that cpp is easier for the data structures, but then what's the point of half the course if we don't learn data structures?  Creating them from scratch is excruciatingly painful, as we saw with linked lists (which was just the beginning), but if we do, we can get better than any other clg
i have busted my ass for y'all for the past two weeks so that you dont fail in the course
As they say, more the pain, more the gain
girish sadist not lini dw
nah guruji ftw guruji op guruji4lyf always🫡
sab sadist hai yaha pe bhai
If you didn’t learn it you don’t get to fuck over the rest of your batch by using a high level language with an unclear base
exactly and right now you guys accusing of such things is really disheartening honestly
nahi nahi lini achi bachi h
That’s literally the worst thing you can do as a programmer
BETTER THAN ANY OTHER CLG UH who tf is competing with us da IIITH>>>>>IITB😡😡
Exactly
lini avg B- gajjar avg B
Cpp is the same as c till it comes to graph bruh so buckle up
WAIT what's going on here ?  PPL ARE MAD AT VEDANT FOR THE C THING?????
Wtfaf
we're going to get fucked over either way  if its in c, atleast we get fucked over in a familiar language
Exactly; stop blaming one of the few people who’s actually in a position to help everybody
real shit
??
I might be speaking for myself, but I was just trying to get things clarified Any offence caused is sorely regretted
bro like didnt we have a poll and all also
sai sankalp
Wait so there r some retards who are unhappy? Lmao wtf
familiar for only half the batch da girish was NOT the guy to teach a bunch of noobs C
why are people mad
Hi
oh fuck off what happened to the "but the entire batch" rhetoric you and aditya were throwing at me 10 seconds ago
That was the clarification 💀
why does it matter to u u r in kassimaxing phase u can do dsa in any lang
poll had different output overall is different output but guruji ftw we love guruji🫡🫡
HECK YEAH
Go vedant
Let's hope star
Gand mar de
we said you should have consulted the batch
F WORD?!!?🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
and we said use c++ or python
POLL: How many are ok with change to c OPTION: Me (19 votes) OPTION: Not me, I want python (12 votes) OPTION: Not me, I want cpp (0 votes) OPTION: I don't care what language it is, I just want to learn how to implement algos (3 votes) 
Guys, why are we mad still, we got C right, atleast we won't have to deal with new untested shit each lab
MPs did their work
kulkarni lite le
They literally did though
yeah we did send the poll in the mail but this was a decision taken by the TAs and senior MPs
good work mps
They got change done
we did in every place possible when the tas and seniors took a decision for us, we did not oppose because it was not our place too. they have sat thru these courses and placements and know what is best for us.
Mps pls pin we can stop the spam
We didn't know that it was the senior MPs who had asked you guys to accept C as a compromise, how are we to have known?
Yes!
Ayo what untested shit da it'll remain untested for only 1-2 labs. Once we get used to it it'll be peas no
I would rather spend 10 minutes implementing an algorithm, rather than an hour
IIT Delhi for example
i told you three times and you guys still said but but but you should've polled the batch
Hi; while we'll always fight for what the batch wants, there are limits we cannot cross. Please trust us on some matters, I hope we've done enough to warrant at least that much :)
Yes yes guruji fan club🔥🔥🔥
I didn't push beyond that now, did I?
i would rather learn the data structure/algorithm than just use something thats already be implemented
POLL: Guruji4lyf? OPTION: Yes (17 votes) OPTION: No (1 vote) 
And here we had it -changed to directly python
Real gand hum marenge aap saans lijiye
did ppl here even got ece there no right then stop blaming guruji
but its good for us 😭
No ones blaming him
iiit isnt most colleges
hes a good fellow
Python DSA is not a new thing tho 😔
kulkarni best
Sorry if it sounded that way @917745090290
IIIT>>>> IITB😡😡😡🔥🔥
Brother, please I have no problems with C anymore
Navey room aaja 🍌
also @917745090290 you're happy with the decision that's why you "don't care" No one is blaming you but as MP you are the person we reach out to for these things
Well, we didn't know what happened behind the scenes either? So how are we to have responded "aptly"?
bhai merge sort chatgpt ko deke aya python se c convert krara
You can't just choose which opinions you care and don't care about
You're a POC
This nigga
If only he had done his job properly
Lmao like they are not gonna do the same goddam course
Nah bro hitler > girish
HATA ISKO NAN
You do realise that getting a course structure changed is a big piece of work right?
Bro just look at how much easier it is to implement things in cpp and python
thats exactly why we need to learn it in c 😭
Vedant and the other MPs worked relentlessly against unreasonable professors and faculty simply to make things easier for us after intense discussions and polls which i remember clearly. Not to mention, all mps consulted numerous seniors, TAs and did extensive research (evident by the detailed pros and cons message they released) and quite frankly some of them are incredibly experienced in the matter as well.    Despite being shot down the fact that they worked so hard to change the system perhaps more than any batch has ever fought for before is insane and instead of gratitude seeing anger is quite baffling in my opinion. Throughout the semesters the MPs have been nothing but extremely hardworking, dedicated and literally committed towards listening to our endless complaints and whining.  I personally want to know and address the PPL who have issues with the MPs and the decisions they've made because ffs they r humans too and they've done too much for us already  @919941637224 @917337295535 Please tell me    It is very easy to be an armchair driver and give criticism while sitting from the comfort of not having to do this work yourself.
what is it that you have a problem with right now? you're not making sense
Yeah, and I apologise for anything that I might have said earlier I can't do much else to set things right
Hitler killed a whole race Girish just gave us bad grading Don't make hitler great Also don't take this negatively, I'm also against girish
Imagine crying for Python/C++ after a month of DSA in C
NAHI GIRISH ?
bro forgot humor
Nah hitler > girish
You do realise it was standard that you do the entire course in C so we do not get fucked in OSN next semester? The TAs and eacha ND every goddam individual of this college told specifically that since we are having it in python, our OSN is gonna get fucked. You do realise that since it is changed to c finally, we might have to type more but the questions will be a little easier than they would have been w python cuz of all the time saving we would have done in typing code ? If you still wanna argue about how python is nice and easy. It is. But nice and easy isn't gonna land u grades in DSA or OSN .
Ok fine
pin this
bhai future lite you have to pass DSA first no C is gonna anal all the chapris da (including me uwu)
Stop twisting my words I never said they don't do a lot for the batch.. I'm giving my opinion just like everyone in the batch does about these things
Agreed
Hail Hitler
Ok Tell me What ur opinion is I wanna know
As clarifications, we sent the original mail to request for cpp and, on advice of senipr mps and tas, c. This was instantly rejected by choppella, and we were stuck with python.  After Lab 2 of python, we took up the case again, and set out a few points saying why the lab wasn't great to the profs (again, on advice of senior mps and tas), and asking if they could do something about that. We did not in any way suggest anything to them. They responded by saying that we would revert to the old course structure.  After giving it a break, we'll ask for cpp if a majority of the batch wants it, but this js how things stand rn
Nah NO FUCKING WAY U SAID THAT
GUYS WTF HOW IS THIS ALLOWED
Kartikeya I cant-
read the conversation
379>1
no you're not giving your opinion you are trying to talk as the entire batch and shitting on every single step we took just because you didnt like the outcome without even listening to what we have to say theres a difference
@mps let me represent u for a change <3
How many times am I going to have to repeat myself  I didn't know the how the whole thing rested, and based off of the little information that I had, I queried the MPs I might have come off as rude, or hurtful, and hence I apologised then, just as I apologise now I was just trying to exercise my right to question the decisions taken by the elected representatives of this batch, and I might have been slightly problematic in the way I dealt with the issue I apologise wholeheartedly for this gaffe @917745090290 @917075970819 @917093200799 and the other MPs
Love you bbg but issok
Sai sankalp is a cutie now
bro when did I say I'm representing the batch
abhi bolre dsa cpp me krao badme osn me royege fir osn ke prof ko ghanta fark nai padta tumse rona fir uske samne jake sir sir cpp me krdo osn
what?
ayo NAH don't do this shit they are giving opinion no that's all no😭  (I just don't want to fail DSA uwu)
ALL HAIL THE GURUJI
Na na lite majakying
kalesh hogaya
Querying the MPs is something to be done in private  In dms Or one on one You do understand human nature to want to create fights and involve in conflict, especially in a batch group of 100+ people When u "state ur opinion" especially when u said you didn't know the whole thing, you are essentially instigating a movement against the MPs and quite literally disrespecting them
Kailash referenced WHAT WHAT FEEELING PROUD INDIAN ARMY😡😡😡😣😡🔥
You're literally starting your opinion right now
It's called a conversation
No I'm stating objective decency 😂
How to not be a shit human
And have gratitude
Anyhow, if anyone has any more doubts regarding the shift to c, feel free to dm any mp
Ayo time to plug debsoc
watch your mouth
ey calm it
Mps admin only time
💀💀
tell her bro
Alright good morning WHAT THE FUCK
i haven't said anything offensive to y'all
DEBSOC MENTIONEDDDDDD
AHAHAHA DEBSOCCC
GUYS PLEASE CALM DOWN IT WAS THE PROFS DECISION MPS CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABT THAT
OSN has labs?
I usually do keep these queries to the DMs, but then on the other hand, I was sure that I was not the only one who might have had some lingering issues with this thing, and hence I messaged here I am so sorry for having stirred up this bee hive @mps
this house believes that Girish verma is retarded.
Obvi
Perhaps you should've from the start
Bcz it's the truth
Guys, I think the change has happened, and its a decent change, for which MPs worked hard. lets just accept the change which was made by profs, and stop fighting amongst ourselves
Seconded
This house believes that hitler > girish
We won't entertain any more doubts here for the time being regarding this :)
i didn't call the mps shit or useless or anything wtf r you talking about
Bros spitting fax
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
haris hehe
DSA in C Das it
Good morning
Dsa is finally decided to be in c
...
WHATTT
.
You
Literally accused him
yes
big difference between what I said aand calling someone a shit human
Let's not go down that rabbit hole again star, please
whatever fuck this I'm out
Ill come back to this after an hour and admin lock byeeee :3

What you said:  Vedant is a selfish person
Traitor
bros literally a pookie
And I'm supposed to "watch my mouth"
Btw guys, how are we gonna complete DSA labs in 2.5 hours in C? this time ma'am said some 80% marks late submition or sth right?
please wait for the mail for more details
Petition to make @919677232382 our Lab proff
It's 3.5
Not 2.5
She said 100% till 5.30
better do u want A at 95 again
Freedom of speech != Freedom from consequences  It's very easy to criticize and whine about the MPs work especially since they're so lenient and sweet about it  Imo they're too understanding  @917745090290 I'm sorry for all the shit u went thru and genuinely grateful for the work y'all hv done
that is fair
Fair macha

Major respect to @917745090290 @917075970819 @917850872190  and all other mps (sorry couldn't attach so many number lol) for all the hard work they've put in! They have been trying to address  our concerns relentlessly at the cost of their own mental and physical health.
Poda I've never seen u type LTTE VAAZHGA
that's what this is between me and LTTE why this checha coming in between da😡😡😡

Thirumalai Nallan Chakaravarthy😡🔥🔥
Can't get more tamil than thay
There's no pongal in any mess except yuktahar
Who even asked fr this actually.  I thought PPL wanted to switch to C++.
We realised. We screwed whether or not we have python, C or cpp.  It wasnt the language that held us back all along 😔
Im in my accent is not normal tho😭
Ask mps in dms
Im in Bangalore da id have spammed otherwise😡😡
Was not it already finalised that it will be python

Can't bear TAMIZH inaccuracies even if I made them da
That's how dedicated I am
I'm sorry - didn't python have more support than c in the poll?
Monish can u even read tamil
but shouldn't we be learning what those are anyways for our careers
profs decision, nothing we can do about it anymore
So why not learn os net just in this sem?
Ya, but it would be better to do them in python than C and to do it in their own respective courses.
Monish read this da
there are no respective courses
Nan permission to steal that  \ / . . --
dsa is the course where you learn how to implement them
not just use them
Chopella's elective is that only
U know what, Petition for ALL 3 Programing languages in DSA at same time. everyone learns everything, no choice. And Infact, inclusivity. Let's include Rust, Js, Java and other minorities too
which one 😭
ok nvm i didnt see the original message
Principles of programming languages
Madarchod Brainfuck hi sikhade
fsms and all lite, choppela said he wouldnt do them in dsa now anyways
Brain fuck hi hogaya hai
Yea true, we include brainfuck too, Infact we will go till binary

Basically Tldr of the important shit  UG1 TAMIZH SANGAM board of directors - nan - olympiad 1 @⁨Sushil IIITH Tamil⁩ - olympiad 2 @⁨~Hari Aakash⁩ - olympiad 3 @⁨Pratyush Vempati IIITH⁩ that's all the rest is irrelevant gibberish
This is the most Josh thing ever
I'm aware of that I also read the tamil lore and the ponnambalam valinayagan written on the blackboard
Not really, I need that extra enlightenment I got from reading all the message lore
Yeah and more beef happened
Tamil lore was yea
Chairs were thrown
Tables were upturned
Orbi8r were beaten
Minds were fucked
Yea
Bottom line: no ones sanity is actually going to be intact until the end of this sem
People screamed out sieg heil
The Weimar Republic came back

Don't worry Mental Health team will just give out more plants

Would u like to be on the board of directors?

Debsoc gc pull up
Lets goo
you were told wrong
Tell that to my dad
Drop his number
still, his work outperforms any single private individual in this century
how
_his_ work?
Private individual?
Give me an emerald mine I'll also do that
Built 3 companies from scratch into billion dollar worth companies
he had funding ok
WAHAHAHHAHAHABA
Dude
HE DID NOT
YOU THINK HE FOUNDED TESLA LMAO
Oh my god this is actually hilarious
...
Big bang theory ahh
lmao what
none of it is his work
ive never heard a single genius idea related to any of those three companies which came from elon hinself
he stole tesla he fucked up paypal he stole spacex
he STOLE tesla
and he fucked up x
doesn't matter.  If it wasn't for his initiative, it wouldn't have been this big
the only company elon has made is the boring company and thats irrelevant
yeah, "x" is what a conpany run by elon looks like
😭😭😭
Me after profiting off child labour run emerald mines, sexually harassing a flight attendant and trying to shut her up by gifting her a horse, disowing my trans daughter and crying about a "woke virus", influencing elections in the US but but but my work OUTPERFORMS
doesnt matter if his companies are big when he uses most of it to just push his political agenda
starlink is pretty cool but then again he just owns it
Elon Musk please unsuspend my Twitter @ChiakhaChief
there is nothing wrong in putting down woke ideologies
Oh
anyone is free to do what they want
oh
my god
Twitter was already ass and now it's even more ass
Which woke ideologies r u referring to
brother what
what according to you is woke culture and why is it bad
multiple media houses and corporates and stuff were strongly funding woke stuff before that also
election interference is not "putting down woke ideologies"
💀💀
btw
i mean he does both but wait i want to hear him explain his side
Same same same
he puts down woke shit on twt all the time
yeah im j saying he does much more than that
yeah but what is “woke ideology” according to you
he didn't do any illegal shit fr elections
R u talking abt the virus?
@917019318279
him being a republican has nothing to do with this be used to be a liberal
what
he literally offered to pay citizens to vote
oj
DEBSOC ACTUALLY PULLED UP 😭😭😭
He didn't do "illegal" shit But he did do completely unethical stuff
Nah he did stuff thats illegal
is unethical not election interference though?
like fr example, teaching small kids gender ideologies and stuff and allowing permanent changes to body at a very young age.  More focus on stuff like gender, race etc etc than on actual stuff like science, tech or people actually getting things they want
man
Actual stuff is crazy
i actually laughed
like ?
It is dw
As a person who loves stem and despises the humanities personally I can assure u one is not "realer" than the other
I was just saying that paying voters to "vote" isn't illegal per se But most of us know what he meant
Us
Why are we even arguing with this guy man ain't even worth it
Dude I actually laughed so much lmao
1) you were taught gender ideology as a kid thats why you knew hwat straight and gay people are 2) no democrat or liberal has ever argued for gender surgery or HRT for minors and its banned everywhere with no exceptions 3) the republican party is literally built upon destroying class solidarity and playing identity politics to create a divide to win votes rather than actual policies, they do not give a shit about science or tech and are usually pretty shit when it comes to those things
I'm literally losing the few iq points I have listening to this guy
I never said that i support republicans unequivocally at all
They also have shit stuff
Can we move this to debsoc oksplspks
This looks so desperate man give it a rest
marketing team working on making the group active 😔
yeah but “woke ideology” falls apart because it’s a narrative pushed by the republican party which uses lies and false narratives to push a false agenda and create a divide of us vs. them
but wokeness is what is defined as too much sensitivity to stuff that doesn't matter much and should be more ignored like race, ethnicity, gender etc.  that is wrong
Since many were questioning me how i am saying ba - bc = 0
Raagav told me to stfu
again, there are always extremists on both side there are 100% radical liberals and left wing people who are too sensitive to these issues

It forms the basis of all maths so

a proper ra course would
idk about the one we had..
Yeah the RA we had was fucked to say the least
But consider RA the cement for the bricls
Or whatever bricks are made of
And maths is the house

What happened to abortion
That was interesting
aborted
:i
:(
Sa
Sad
Another unique topic: should u give lift to someone in need at a deserted place at night?
Not anymore 😔
Join the gc and asl
I want abortion
Why wouldn't you? It's very circumstantial
too much risk tho
Bro plz use plain english next time  i have to google before replying
.
Eh it would probably be better to give a lift if it's a woman
out of context
no
are you denying me the right to abort rushil 😔
Never
pause what
romantically yes, otherwise no way
Coz sometimes its like a bait
misogyny in the unofficial group? 😳😳😳
DISCYSS IN
? what did we do man
DEBSOC GROUP
There can be goons beyond her
it's gonna become vivek talwar shit bcs of the ethics behind it lol
ROMANTICALLY WHAT
bro pragati
Ok
shut up 😭😭😭
No
Ayo bro not that way, I'm talking about the woman's safety 💀
<3
I mean its risky whoever it is
her skill issue for getting deserted
why do u say that a woman asking for a lift is better than a man asking for a lift
She might also be escaping some bad people
aren't u worried about the man's safety
skill issue get away faster
Cuz it's more dangerous for a woman to be out alone at night?
ok wait
Another way keep all ur winfows shut and ask the guy to jump over the car
so a woman is less likely to shank you from behind is what ur saying
why would you even be in a deserted place in the first place
Just realised i was there only to add a new topic of discussion  not to debate
Serial killer vibes
She can be even drugged to such a place
whatd I js read

Josh's aura broke WhatsApp 😂😂
I know this has happened to someone before here so if that same person could help would be appreciated
if u find the answer plz share 🙏
Whatsapp ain't built for me today it's creating the draft, tomorrow I'll manage to send it, destroying apex's apex powers
I still have this draft d8nce 5th jan
Yeah that's just whatsapp bugging out when we search for a reaction emoji and then click it
Yeah same way
Wait I think there's a way to solve this
If we can type in that group we can get rid of it
But only admins aka apex can type
So
@mps how do I become apex
Is vc open today?
Yeah I need to know too
Did Praveen sir share the slides of his class with us?
For CSO
Nah I don't trust them zip files
Diee
is vpn working?
Yep
Ok Moe Lester
What's with the alpha sigma lone wolf ahh response
Bro actually showed up to my room stop stalking me
Beautiful
how are you ppl doing this lmao
Idk
:0
1. Select a message to react to it 2. Click on the plus symbol 3. Search for the name of an emoji 4. Click it and it'll appear in draft
huuh
interesting
Huh it's not working for me
Click it twice
Man imagine not being able to send messages in the announcements grp
First time just reacts, 2nd time adds to draft
ok
how to remove this
That's the neat part, you don't
Did... you not read up on why this entire thing started
No
no
Welp you're stuck with it now
what if I leave
This is why you read the warnings before using a product
Idk
Please don't
And join again duh
I'm not dumb
You lose all the previous messages by doing that :,)
Don't :,)
Ok -_-
I think i get to flex once in a while 😌

Guruji built different 🔥🔥🔥

inesh saar 🫡🫡
Hiiiii 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Toilet paper?
Yes
i think i am missing context 0_0
Us
Damn didn't know mps had alt accounts
One expects students of this college to have passed 12th too 💀
Nah I'm pretty sure you're the only one who'd look stupid
We'd be in the same boat then <3
@mps when next boat trip for this batch?
4th year
Rly?
yea there will be another batch trip then
Ask girish, given how determined he is to drown us all
assuming the college approves it ofc
😭😭😭
Imagine being that stupid must be sad
College lite
yes this is my copium
In the mess lines? No shit
Or just become mps and tag along with next year facchas
It's ok joshua life gets better
mps nahi apex
Apex
ew who wants to be apex
Idt mps go on batch trip lmao
Ngl i thought u would
We'd still make u apex guruji
Tbh after being in sp idw to be apex
Apex predator Vedant
Nah I love being stupid (idk how I'm supposed to survive this sem)
90% of apex is there for the power trip lmao I don't want to spend half the semester managing all those egos I'd rather be in parliament
0_0
Facchas suck lmao
valid honestly
No offense
No one can even show a tiny bit of ego in front of the pure being of aura that is guruji
I thought I'd join apex at the beginning of first sem, but parliament is more rewarding
Guruji will bring any cocky apex members to their knees
You can join apex in 1st sem?
what weird kink is this
rewarding? as in getting undue credit for all of the institute's mistakes?
She meant in the future
Every day I thank god I didnt get elected as an MP :D
No -_-
This
you had a good response to the question someone asked iirc
Thank you batch for not voting me love yall 🙏🙏
I mean it's not like i take any of it to heart lmao
lmfaoooooo
U ran for mp?
Duh
Damn I don't even remember u existing back then
us fr
My existence is very hard to notice but once noticed very hard to ignore
wait why does no one want to be mp
Is that supposed to be a flex
Maybe I'll try
Is a statement
It makes u sound like a pesky fly
Saar you blew off steam on this very group yesterday after people went off on you for DSA in C
Bzzzzzt 🪰🪰🪰🪰🪰🪰🪰🪰🪰🪰

that was my skill issue tho
Yeah and? Shouldn't he let out steam
I disagree We ought to have been more clear headed too
Let's hope enough people stand for elections next time man 💀
Everyone was on his ass bcoz of this shitty ass institute
We phrased it really shittily
_the very calm and collected Vedant Kulkarni ji lost it_
lmaoo idk if even existing mps will stand again
_imagine the status of someone who is hot headed_
Yeah lmao we alr know some people who won't (and honestly, fair enough)
hmm its alright it happened now mistakes were made from all sides i guess
Yeah I'd prolly dump the 700+ reaction images I have all at once
I didn't read the word "headed" initially 💀

i’m too used to this now

Tomorrow is wednesday what cso what iot
I mean you can use up your leaves
grade drop is always an option rushil
Isn't there some responsible student program too
what
Not for core courses
Ohh kk
Not for cpre cpurses
Only electives
If anyone wants an explanation, look it up on intranet
Such students would be eligible for only the grades A, A-, B, B- or F.  In other words, grades lower than B- will be treated as F.    Rip 💀
Wait what !
Wtaf
damn nice
Please tell me that’s voluntary
And you don’t have to be a responsible student
Yes it is
But the pro is 0% attendance policy
yea
you have to go and talk to the prof for them to allow it
and not for corr courses
As usual everything is in the hands of the holy prof
CPro reference💀
Do we have lab tmrw? Iss
Guys, did they send mail regarding tht python or c thingy

brudah leaking secrets 😯
Arey what secrets
Personal kinks, related to kys... that's bds... 😔  I didn't expect this from you
anyways, I'm selling Personalized diy kys Kit plus I'll dispose in wet or dry waste bins as per requested by client.  (finally a business idea which works in engineering college)
I unironically support th waste bins idea because I do NOT want a repeat of the [redacted] water incident
Tantra prices updated 😔🙏
What items/how much?
Everything, +10 to +20
tch tch such loss
Since amen sir has disapproved of my message I am now encouraging everyone to but pentaprism merch (pls notice me amen sir)

Are you living under a rock? Or just ragebaiting or y genuinely have a shit opinion

Me on my way to build a teleportation machine
Do you not trust the mps? I am sorry (not really) but how fucking retarded are you that yout troglodyte of a brain cannot show even the tiniest ounce of trust for the great and respectable mps who put in the time and effort to cater to our whims and fancies without much reward? This is absolutely shameful behavior and you frankly deserve all this bs that is happening to you. Genuinely, just kill yourself you vapid communal flashlight
ig it's sexist then
I'll take u up on that
Umm.... I was one of the ppl defending the mps
[friendly fire]   (me, the guy shittin on MPs)
Yeah and now you're not showing any trust for their words, stop the cap
I was just asking when the mail will come
Im already too poor WHAT DAFUUUUUUUQ
Why aren't people TRREIIIIPPPIIIIINNBGGG
what?
BRO they can't increase prices da I'm too broke tfff
If I wash dishes for them they'll feed me for free uh

That's not how it sounded, plus who needs the mail when the mps have given their word? This is absolutely shameful behavior from your end
@917204430421 ig, your in this situation too
Fuck yeah very much so
the tas have said it'll come by tonight ;_; what else can i say
Ohh kk tq
What we have supposed to do when we recieve oj regarding mail? Should we login in that?

Please let me go

Get a room
It's be more than half an hour
Pls send help
not trust the mps??? tatva moment
I mean you can try nothing in the iiith rules that says you can't have another source of income
⁉️
Or you know that on line from dumb ways to die?
"Sell both your kidneys on the internet"
Or sell them to me I'll give good deals
Ehh brains usually don't sell that well
In the medical field u can't replace a brain like a heart or kidney
U can store it na
And even on the culinary side even though it is a delicacy people don't eat it because they cause prion diseases
please hesitate
Tf u mean store it u can't use a brain to save someone's life
Ok I have a strong 💪 niggr hand
I mean would you eat a scrambled egg that's been on the windowsill
I hope i'm making that reference right lmao
I'll see if there's some random rich collector who wants a human brain but even then u won't get much since like u know, dead people exist, they can go to the mortuary and get one relatively cheap
We can store gurji ka brain
have we received any mail regarding of change in language from python to c
Eyy fuck off gurujis brain is a blessing to society and must stay with him, watch your words
The tentative date for the dsa assignment was yesterday ryt. Why is it not yet out?
It is on oj
I can see some questions on oj server
I'm not sure if u talking abt cooking it or what
But I don't think think that actually helps
Yes this is in my search history now
I heard that canibilsm is not illegal In india
Yeah that's true
But still eating the brain is not recommended
So people please stop telling me u have a brain to sell just sell your kidney mam it's much more expensive and doesn't detriment your health that much
Dude just get tantra man
null
No
I can mess up with this now😝
What do u mean
Don't leak your passwords please
Dude
Did u see my password
Seacc
Yup yup
Did u not get the joke
Lmao akshit
Come on man hack me
Bro was acting like he did something smart
My actual password is something else
It's a make some noise reference 😔

Welcome to OJ :(
That's what she asked
Is oj bad or good compared to pingala
Seniors used oj we used pingala
OJ need as self written main file too which has to handle taking in operations
so its just another step to do, rest ig everything is normal
Actually, before C(if we were using python or cpp)  the lab would have been easier due to premade list function. Now with C, DSA lab will be harder. The leakage should increase with C and container should burst open.
I mean the fact that it broke through one of the strongest fixing materials in the world, flex tape, implies that the water flow has increased hundred fold
HAPPY BDAY SANYAMSEAC

Hello everyone and welcome to the first ever IIIT Pokemon Community Playthrough. In these playthroughs we shall be picking up a Pokemon game (mainline for now) and we shall relive the good old days by playing through them.  RULES: To participate, first fill this form: https://forms.gle/uRJbe1hbDC9v1iHW6. Then, join the Pokemon fan club group on WhatsApp: https://chat.whatsapp.com/EVZRBU8OkZW53ORHBEjPof. This is important as all ROM files and emulator files will be uploaded on this group, along with the playthrough discussion. We have set up a few checkpoints. Reach the checkpoint before the deadline (These deadlines are flexible do not worry) and send a screenshot of your team and the save dialog, showing the time taken and Pokedex numbers, either personally to me or in the group. This has to be done after every checkpoint. You can continue playing, but DO NOT cross the boundaries of the checkpoint, until the deadline is finished. The idea is for the players to go through the game together. ALL SORTS OF HACKING AND CHEATS ARE BANNED. You may trade with any other participants but inform me whom and what the trade was. Have fun <3  Our very first playthrough will bring us back to the good old days of Hoenn, traversing the infinite sea paths in the region. We shall be running Pokemon Emerald!  Here are the checkpoints for Pokemon Emerald: 18th - 23rd: Defeat Wattson and obtain the Dynamo Badge from Wattson. Do not obtain the Rock Smash HM yet. 24th - 29th: Defeat your rival after obtaining Castform from the Weather Institute. Do not battle Winona yet. 2nd - 7th: Break up Groudon & Kyogre by summoning Rayquaza. Do not battle Juan yet. 8th - 13th: Defeat Wallace and be crowned Hoenn Champion!  After you defeat Wallace, send your entire team, including moves on the Pokemon to either me or in the group and they will be recorded in the Hall of Fame.  Happy Playing! Reach out to me if you have any questions whatsoever.

It's chumma timepass meet only
How much are they offering you for this
...
COME FELICITY MEET 9:30 VARY FUN NO KASSI ALLOW
For once I am glad to be on that stupid kassi list
Guruji she said no kassis you don't have to repeat it
Aw man :(

my message has been misinterpreted
I meant
Don't kassi come to the 9:30 meet in the amphi instead
Plej guruji plej grace us with your prsence
Don't call it stupid nigha
Yeah I shouldn't call it stupid, it has saved me from this shit
Joshua come da it'll be fun da
Unfortunately, due the timings (night) being inconvenient for my visibility, I am forced to gracefully decline
nan why would you make this
Dear Joshua, I believe that all humans irrespective of their skin colour must be actively included in all activities we perform conjugatively as a society, simply because this policy forms the base of humanity.
HELL YEAH
they told me to man I just do my job
RUSHIL GG ASF
It appears my explanations were not properly explained. At the given timings it will be too dark for people to see a dark-skinned individual such as myself, due to the limitations of the human eye to not be able to differentiate dark objects in a dark setting. Participating would only be an inconvenience for people, who would find it difficult to interact with me given my invisible nature, no matter how much they believe in the equality of all
Yall will do this sort of promo and wont even show up later on 💀
Anyways forget meet JOIN EMERALD PLAYTHROUGH RAAAAH https://forms.gle/uRJbe1hbDC9v1iHW6
Dear Joshua, I don't think you understand the empathy behind my message. Yes, I realize that you are very dark, maybe even too dark to be seen in such a setting. However, the inconvenience of other people must not be your concern. I assure you that with my 6/6 vision, I will be able to spot you in even the darkest of scenarios. Yours, Kim Jong Un

South mess has slowly gotten so much worse day by day

why'd this convo die down this quickly?
Tuts
you're g1, right?
i'm g4 so i don't have one rn
Yes
csd enjoy
I saw that I had a tut at 12.40 just after I finished oiling up my hair at 12
what? do men actually oil their hair lol
I do it before washing my hair (or atleast what's left of it)
damn desperate measures for accelerated balding
are they planning to take a tut quiz today?
Na
ohkay from the next tut onwards then?
Tf? Then why did I rush my ass here
attendance?
I've been oiling my hair before a bath since I was a kid 😭
lol ok
Whats the use then
my dermat advised me against it
i never used to like it anyways
💀
Tf u mean "what's the use"
My dermatologist straight up gave me minoxidil
It's washed away when u do a head bath
To moisten my scalp or shit idk man
It used to be underrated   Now there's too many people there😭
fr? damn that's sad
I'm the last person who needs to be nerfed like this college has fucked up my hair for good
It's the same for all messes because of UG1 having similar timings as others
last sem it was ok for me but this sem it's gotten really bad but my hair's too thick anyways so fuck it honestly
there's barely anyone in yuktahar for breakfast tho'
For good reason
it's better than kadamb's tbf
Excuse me?
It's not the case after 9
i had that for breakfast last sem and it was horrendous
Ik kadamb is shit
i usually go after that
But I will not stand for anyone supporting yuktahar
*breakfast
maybe but south's not my taste and north's too greasy
South is basically the best option among these shit messes
But yeah north is greasy af
I missed a dsm and a ds class on two separate occasions coz that oil did not sit well with me
bro idk i'm not acquainted with that cuisine tbf
i straight up couldn't have dinner on the 2 days i had lunch at north
skill issue
REMINDERRR 9pm bakul warehouse. NSFW quiz nan guarantee its going to be very fun.
COME WITH PARTNERRRR :)))

Why are u making it restrictive
Wow finally... now i am assured it won't happen again 😌
Thanks for the warning I ain't eating south today
Bro its kryptonite
But genuinely this mess system is so ass you're basically being forced to eat unhygienic food
Lab starts at 2 right?
220
Only for groups 1 and 2
2 for everyone else
i live to serve
Nah I can come without also dw
Walk innn
Did you report this to the person at the desk
@ecx folks, how does zia sir look like?
can anyone give me a description asap?
areee this was when he was younger lol
bro people don’t change that much after they’re like 40 💀
fine i think i got it right but what if it's some other prof
i'm a farce anyways so fuck it ig
nope
-_-
Why
Why would you not
If you still haven't got an inkling about the theme of the quiz, here's a bonus hint for you. 🤑 Prize Money - ₹6900 Only  See you in the warehouse!😉  TVRQC
FUCK YEAHHH
🧢
sureeee
The quiz stands postponed (no, not cancelled, and no, it wasnt a made-up event) to a later date. We hope to see you then!  In the meantime, we do have another quiz in the pipeline (watch our announcements! hint: Melas are fun), as well as the regular KCircle meets that are now being scheduled on Saturdays from 4 PM onwards.
Sus
@917075970819 is that a trap
For kalakshetra
No it's not
I couldn't care less abt kalakshetra
And this doesn't affect you guys until end of feb -_-
the other questions will be posted on OJ later?
May we know what you need this information for (research purposes)
Hey ive seen that crow before
It's yours I just made it into a sticker
Given that friday dsa labs are lagging in c, the tas are trying to hold an extra lab in feb end
Yeah I noticed that lmao
That's why
Hope you are satisfied with my work
We're lagging in C?
Aren't both sections running parallely now?
Aren't we ahead of them
We were ahead by one lab, which was conducted today
They didn't have the functional programming lab
One lab behind wrt to c
Don't think so
In the same week? How is that "behind"?
Yeah actually we're very busy from 2-5 on Tuesdays very difficult very sorry
The functional programming lab is irrelevant because we're focusing on c now
Ask the tas :)
Both sections have had only 1 C lab insofar
-_-
With 1 every upcoming week
We had 2 python labs, while tue and wed had one each before shifting to c
They're making up for the one lab lost to python
no no its not kalakshetra chill
Cam never be too safe these days
Btw we're not gonna use the announcements channel for non mp stuff -_-
ikr
What? Shouldn't section A have the extra lab then? In Python?
I can promise that
we're not apex
come on ;_;
As we're speaking I am thinking of a game plan to avoid getting caught
Yeah :<
Extra experience
I still fail to see how any section is lagging w.r.t the other in C
Keep failing
Oi
Technically we can call it as the other section starting before us
But let me know if your tuesday schedule is free from 2-5
Tuesdays are free for CLD as of now
I am very sorry I would _love_ to have dsa lab (very exciting and non stressful) from 2 to 5 on a Tuesday but due to very unforseen circumstances which are very important we are very busy, I really regret this unfortunate situation
Group?
-_-
10
But this is shared with CHD too
Don't make me pull up the schedules myself and cross check please 😭
Sankalp stop outing people man have some courtesy
Haww
ve flashbacks 🌝
I agree
Yes, indeed

Glimpse of last year Flashmob ✨✨ https://youtu.be/w0tsWM3lDgY?si=LM5zxeDAf7GNsEQ3 1/20/25, 12:46 AM - ~ Kartik Thapa pinned a message
Is Moodle down?
I think its always down bw 2 and 2.30
Not sure tho
yes
for maintenance
Haa
Wtf
Oh okay
it's ok you can kassi without Moodle for half an hour
I'm only awake because of this report fuck you
what report 😭
AEC
ece shit
dw
lab report 1?
Ye
oh ok
lol
Heheh imagine having to make reports
Don't you have IoT
Yes
But
2 per week
I mean
???
1 per 2 weeks
no?
I mean only 1 person has to submit
so we take turns
wtfff this is unfair
Yeah idk why they're making us do this
EW was fine
ok
Isn't it the same amt lmao
tht was 2 labs per week, we would've actually died if it was per person report
Only one report per team
True
but yeah, they should've just made it one report per team for AEC also
you had DSM why y'all complaining 😭
especially considering we hv to go after lab hours to finish work
Bro my TA literally wasn't opening my reports it was so nice
💀💀I think same only
dsm we finish work in lab plus the lab reports were small
comparatively atleast
haa ig
Lab reports to chalta rahega..... but don't forget to participate in FLASHMOB goiz 😂😂💃🏻💃🏻
"Did you inform the mess staff?"
Yes I fucking did coz I knew that would be the first question to be asked
This entire mess system is in need of a change
All of the messes have hygiene issues
Yes💪🏼
That's the thing, reporting at the front desk doesn't really do shit
They see it and move on coz no matter what happens the college has their backs and will force students to eat there
Mr. Ya disagrees He would like to _poent_ to the fact that they are taking "steps" to sort the issues
Unless you have more money to spare for canteens, u are fucked
I don't care if the mess is shit, let us atleast eat our own food
Forcing us to eat there is just more money grubbing
Ok thanku
Damn they playing the fucking big bang theory in iot
Isnt that a velocity selector?
Tf is that?
I see north pole and south pole wow fancy magnets
:) it's to experimentally prove that electrons have spin
oo fun
Csx kids dng DIY expirements 💀
Cnd 👍
Just use a microscope or sumtin
-_-
And look at it
Spin is a magnetic property
Why is it called spin then do people not know how to name stuff
Oh it's a quantum mechanic spin concept
Like it's not something you can visualise as spinning
But yeah
Did anyone got marked absent for ISS on 11th though they attended the class
Ah yes, Americans, famous for not copying and being completely honest

Mail acads office regarding any discrepancy in attendances please
Idk in general but not wrong in their lecture halls it's so much quieter and focused than ours ngl
academics@iiit.ac.in
and cc badri.rayi@iiit.ac.in
Idk its just what we see from like the top unis and stuff
Most of the schools I'd argue are more unruly than ours
Are we not in a top uni
😔
no
cope
Bruh
Arey iiit very small college saar we don't get much fees saar we need to expand saar

Does ims show attendance records of classes before 10th Jan?
Same—
@mps
All attendances are not updated
Hi so i put this on the announcements but pls wait a while
They do this manually so
This is as retarded as the mess system
Can't they like automate it
I am stupid but pls correct me
It is the exact same as the mess system
They do both manually lmao
Yeah hence my statement
If we fix the mess system we're gonna try and get them to change this as well
But ye
I didn't think they'd implement this shitty system here as well
Well
You thought wrong
iiit never fails to disappoint me

Shell scripting for doing basic programming stuffs is so shittty Need to remember where to add space  ., strings automatically converting to integers at some point... And adding fuel to the fire, there are few syntactical difference between bash and zsh (zsh being more lenient) (does not need to add space between operators in [[ ]])... this is so stupid
I have no idea what you are talking about and frankly, I'm scared
if ydw use zsh download bash w homebrew
What is any of this is it important?
iss
mac issue
Start the iss assignment and try to write the code by urself without letting gpt write the whole code  u will understand
Zsh > bash
Well fuck I haven't started it, when do we have to submit it?

Ok I still have hope
yes but
were using bash regardless
I know
LETS GO FUCK YUKTAHAR
Will grish replace yuktahar now?
YUKTAHAR WORST MESS CONFIRMED
😂😂
YUKTAHAR 🤮🤮🤮
where was this reaction when stapler was found in north and plastic found in your pesarattu in south 😁
1. I don't eat north 2. All the messes are ass, if I'm gonna eat unhygienic food might as well as eat the better tasting ones 3. Yuktahar has rats on the floor where u sit and cockroaches on the table, yeah no the plastic is fine
Kadamb food quality is better tho (but they gjve kess chicken nowadays)
Except for the fact that flies were hovering over curd today
Kausheya blink twice if u are being held at gunpoint
Its better than south nowadays
Uh huh...
This sounds like propaganda
"Yeah bro this new professor is pretty good except for the small irrelevant fact that he's the literal reincarnation of Hitler not even kidding God descended from the heavens and confirmed that it is hitlers soul, but other than that awesome prof bro trust me"
Zigga what?
yes
What did you do for the last 18 years of your life
Smh
😭
Regretting that i am too late..   i should give up before chintu becomes the next ceo of google
Yeah, even this is advanced u should've started when u were still a tiny white squiggle
Selling pani puri is always an option
Yeah in my mother's womb (actually i had to prepare for jee before birth)
Yeah i will open my own stall in iiit
You should've learnt to balance ur study schedule way back then, studying jee alone there is not enough
Yess
Dumb of me
See this is how you end up with a dead student
This isn't even about hygiene if u had swallowed that u would've needed a medical emergency
If u feel uneasy make me ur roommate (free cg)

@mps  Can we somehow get the number of minimum leave days to 2 instead of 3? Especially in this horrible HMPV/flu whatever the fuck the season is  Everybody I know has been falling horribly sick in the past week, I think the numbers will only increase in the next month as well
Unfortunately not
Millions of people have tried and they have all failed
Bro I'll make the stupid admin office get this HMPV and force them to clean the road da😭
I fucking caaannntttt
Write a mail to them :)
💀I ain't doing what the mps can't do bhai out of my aukat😭
Guys what is a Kalakshetra
What to work
Don't have to work if u don't get caught
Yeah  not like me
Decorations and shi
Hide in washroom of cursed wing
You can mail and get them to tell you why they can't do it so
Actually good plan ain't no sane person going in _there_
Nah u telling no is enough ywy
If you say so
when ur submitting leave application I'd say just add an extra day
is the dr in arogaya retarded or what  i have 101 fever with bad sore throat and extreme headache and i asked for leave and she goes with i can’t give you leave leave is granted when you have severe case that is cancer or any limb dislocated
yes apparently you cant apply for sports leave if you have minor injuries, you can only if its like fractures and so on
God why are they always so problematic 😭
this is wjat the doctor told me
not sports leave but academic leave
i know
just saying
its such a headache
real
What the actual fuck is this bs
0_0
"Severe case like cancer" who the fuck is attending college when they have fucking cancer
i laughed at her and argued then she gave me a leave and acted like she’s doing me a great favour
Did they seriously say the words cancer and limb dislocation
im gonna cripple myself so i get infinite sports leaves
just sleep and worry abt it later tbh.... its not gonna do any good in that condition
yes word to word
@917719856222 was with me she can confirm
yeah they did for real
that is definitely not institute policy lmao
sorry you had to go thru that
God it'a fucking sisyphean 😭😭😭😭😭😭
please take care, we'll see what can be done
Yes for sure
give the dr a reason to take leave :)
real
This is valid grounds for leave request so we'll see
They don't give leave for cancer 💀
do they give leave for death?
"Sorry mate, you got 4 months to live but ur still gonna fail ur course"
Exam gonna make for an ass finale
gonna be on my deathbed and nagaraju won’t give me sports attendance because i’m in a hospital gown and not shorts and a tshirt
"Sorry bro you can't enter heaven not enough sports attendance"
Sports shoes where?!!!?
~wear boxers~
how dare you go barefoot to hospital
Smh
niggaraju guards hell
BRO SAME WTF
tanishi
same
Imagine if in hell the only way to redeem yourself is to get enough sports attendance from niggeraju
that muslim chick no
Saar I missed DSA Lab bcoz I have lung cancer saar please give leave saar
sorry leave not accepted cuz its not brain cancer 🤡
Yeah the same has happened with me, they are actually waiting for u to get worse and then ask for leave ..makes no sense
Does everyone who work here have ego issues or sumtin that they feel the need to screw over random teenagers
Yup they said last sem  Don't take dolo Let the fever reach high temperature Get it checked in arogya and then take dolo 🤡
Bro that Aarogya fucker fucked me up too when I had leg pain bcoz I fell from cycle
I had beg for him to put some Volini
WHO THE FUCK HIRED THESE GUYS
Simply love the people and their fragile egos so much 🔥🔥
yeah they are not at all considerate
These people are actively worsening students health so that they can sell medicine or shit
btw does clg accept medical reports from other hospitals? or it takes only aarogya?
This shouldn't even be legal
Anywhere 1/22/25, 12:21 PM - Poonam: They don't charge for meds tho yeah?
Willing to bet that he said something along the lines of "it's all in your head"
then taking a report elsewhere is much better than taking at aarogya (except for the fact that it costs outside)
so true
They don't give meds💀
If they aren't charging then that makes it even more psychopathic
They give like two dolo max
They don't even give more than 2 strepcils at once afaik 💀💀💀
they prescribe for a week, and then give u a sample that works for 1 (or at most 2) days
Honestly whenever I go to aarogya anymore I don't tell them my condition or ask them to do any checks I just tell them what medicines I want and they hand it over 😭 not sure if it's a clinic or a dispensary atp
Easier to self diagnose and self treat + actually getting leave even with a medical certificate is a pain
The getting leave part is the issue, everyone knows aarogya is shit, but getting leaves is problematic when its shit
Easy, if your fever is really bad just get cancer or break one of your limbs so that they'll give you leavw
How many limbs can you break before you have to deal with the bureaucracy again
Hopefully by the time you get a fever again one of the broken bones should've fixed fully to break again
Yes it takes from other hospitals
But you have to get aarogya medical certificate in the end
its just a bunch of losers going on a power trip
So even if u fucked, aarogya can just say no?
No, aarogya has to give medical certificate if you have a prescription
They don't have a say in that
No not afaik i got mine approved without aarogya
Idk then -_-
But yea arogya complies when u have medical certificate
They write prescription no matter what
Other way round but yes
Do we get hot water from the water coolers across campus or does it not work?
Huh?
They do work
you do in obh outside south ness
and in a6
Vindhya ?
besides that ehh
What abt that chlorine issue?
which one
Summon the seacc
Idk there was smth right
Ye pretty sure it's fixed
It was fixed way back when
>Healthy sleep >Sleep in ISS
Ohk
Cool ty <3
Goated prof fr
Like if you have prescriptipn they will give certificate fpr sure
Sleep in LA 🥰
Take a walk
And never go back

Nop 1/22/25, 10:47 PM - +91 7397 498 522: I need ALL folks to come out tomorrow for flash mob practice from 830pm
No
Sure bro after 28 th 1/22/25, 10:48 PM - +91 7397 498 522: No I said tomorrow 1/22/25, 10:48 PM - +91 7397 498 522: You will go tomorrow 1/22/25, 10:48 PM - +91 7397 498 522: We’re doing a fire Telugu song you do NOT wanna miss

Yeah but
not fun
Dsa lab on friday
Not fun
Not fun (plz coffee instead)
Not fun
@917745090290 I think u should battle the TA 1v1 and if u win then get free credit and give us also
💀💀💀
Guruji knows more than the ta he should be teaching them not the other way around
Can't moss cahtgpt
Sanyam stop typing
what’d he do to you
Why is both the TA and sanyam typing
sanyam pls type
I can't listen to all that yap
Then don't, no one asked u to
sanyam pls type
😔
Mb sanyam my dms are always open to type in
I don't think TAs can do anything in this case. I'm gonna talk to prof. on Saturday about moderation in GenAI usage or something similar to make everyone learn topics properly rather than 'only' prompt engineering. If anyone has any idea on what can be done, please share
❤️❤️❤️
And will ask to keep this lab ungraded as well
Sanyam the goat fr
Though, you all know ISS prof
More than moderation, I'd suggest a larger time frame to solve the questions  The problem is clearly the fact that we do not have the time to think/apply/understand chatgpt's answers which caused this debacle in the lab Given enough time, it shouldn't matter whether people used AI or not, since at that point, everyone would more or less have a right answer, and those who choose the easier way of prompt engineering would be at a significant disadvantage
This point is going to be there for sure

Hi guys! To help decrease vedant's workload, please respond to the poll below Everyone feel free to reach out to your peers who may be comfortable in topics you're struggling with, there's no shame in it and we should all be learning and growing together!!
What poll
POLL: Are you comfortable with git? OPTION: No (52 votes) OPTION: Yes, but not able to help (19 votes) OPTION: Yes, and willing to help (8 votes) 
Wait re
@admins pin pls 1/23/25, 9:33 AM - ~ Vedant K pinned a message
Tag all the kassis
ppls please do ask anyone willing to help :)
and please don't be in that mode of competition ki if i help someone they will score better than me
man please stop calling people that
these are skills that are really required in the future, make sure you take any opportunity to learn them
Cope harder rizzlyvik
everyone is just as kassi as everyone else
I'm being serious
Man who hurt you
it's ridiculous atp
Focus on helping vedant
I'm just saying man I'm sick of people calling each other kassi
how, i'm ecx I don't have iss
I would if I used git 😢
You can still harass ~kassis~ people who are good with git
rey 💀
Also just to reiterate, please do use this website wherever needed👇 https://devresourcesiiith.github.io  One of the main motivations behind it was the fact that ISS is a very fast-paced course that doesn't vertically explore any topics too much
I'm confused so will yesterday's be graded or not?
still graded :/
Idm graded
I'm scared abt moss 💀
They won't moss for the first part ryt? All the answers were like 1 line
eh lite dw
Realistically except for the CTF qs there wasn't any scope for MOSS regardless of how fucked the lab was
If you are still not comfortable with git, please visit the git related links from this for sure. They are quite good
At first i read it as 'girl'
did you realise its not when you didn't see 99% no :P
Yeah
yo where are iss class slides
or workbook whatever it was
where tf do i learn bash from and exactly what anol do i learn😭 everything on moodle is just git git git
Is Tomm’s Dsa lab graded

Someone give Q1 testcases 😭 isn't that supposed to be the easiest one how is that one not working for me
rest in pieces
I suffered bruh
I suffered
That question is pain
_pain_
Did you check what your code returns when there are two unique pairs that return the same sum @917075970819? And what does it return when there are two pairs with the same sum and the same first element?
Give me concrete test cases
Because what I've checked works
Hold on
4 1 2 4 5 4  I think this should return 1 2 and not 1 4
If my input format is right, that is
Because i know that  1 1 3 4 6 8 returns 3 4
Augh 😭
Sorry for dsa in unofficial btw 💀
1 2 3 4 5 5 Does this work, too?
And is it a WA that OJ is throwing?

Vedant op fr I didn't give a shit abt this prof until he accused vedant
He was using it for the first 30 minutes, I don't think he was after that
Why not bully him when you get the chance :) ?
Especially if he does so in the whole of parliament
Isn't vedant the one bullying you
It's mutual
Is this cope?
You getting bullied is your skill issue honestly
~yes~
He using abusive words is not my skill issue. I can't use abusive words in a formal setting if he does
Nope pretty sure he was the entire time, just not when das called him out lmao
Oh fair enougj
Lite ig
I think so. The first 30 minutes is for sure
If he can use abusive words why can't you sounds like a skill issue on your end sanyam

Right, but still try going between 10-12 and 2-4

if yes, then select the check certification option and click 'trust' or any similar option that pops up
I dont know how to reconfigure it
The only thing ive done till now is the good ol Forget and Connect
yeah that's what i meant don't try resetting your dns or making it manual and then entering the ip
that's gonna mess things up
btw did they show this?
Nope
try doing this once again
Done it didnt work :(

no dsa quiz bruh
what world are you in 😭😭
Exactly
Wait really?
brother
she announced this in the first fucking class
In my defense I'm retarded
Forgot to pay attention 😔
"gReEn TsHiRt"
Yes that is the same green tshirt
is anybody writing cso notes 1/27/25, 6:52 PM - Hemang: no
so the legends are true
SH3 exists
No
he goes page by page from textbook
This
la's honestly the same but you've gotta write notes to stay awake lmao
Na he makes sure ur awake
When is LA exam ?
prolly friday
but that’s an assumption
that's true
It will be either tom or fri right ?
yeah
not tmrw pls
imma die fr
99.99999999% no la tomorrow
So don't worry
How can it be tomorrow
He didn't even inform
were any of the other tut grps taught rank of matrices in the tut?
plsss confirm
cuz i'm not being able to determine it in some cases
?
It said in the mail everythjng else will be in class hours rtt
We don't even know syllabus
consider that ki it'll be there till invertible matrices
some part of it is left but imo that'll be covered in tmrw's lec
yes and we have LA on friday whats ur point
.
yeah because he cant do it tomorro
Fair
ISS: 29th CSO: 31st IOT: 1st DSA: doesn't exist LA: TBA
correct no
LA is 99% friday
1% tmrw?
It's 1001% Friday rushil 😭
learn how to avoid accountability
sir is correct 10% of the 90% of the time.
IOT is 31st, CSO 1st
i always bet on that 1% odds
thats how u win gambling
oh oof fuck dis shit
Zgamlojng bad
sem3 grind da sem2 lite
DID SOMEONE SAY GAMBLING⁉️
I FUCKING LOVE GAMBLING ‼️
i beg to differ worst case = you lose 100% best case = you win 1000000%  1000000% > 100%  hence proved
If you don't gamble, you have a 100% chance of not making money. If you do gamble, you have a less than 100% chance of not making money
Tamil? How dare you 💀😂
Did... did he just call that tamil?
Blasphemy

4 if you decide to consider that my mom's side of the family yaps in telugu all the time
josh at his nani's house
I'm the only one who doesn't know telugu real awkward shit at family gatherings when I have to ask some random relative I've never even heard about but pretend to know to speak know tamil or english coz idk telugu
speak in english in family gethering just to look very (over) smart
@malluls do yall want mallu stickers?
yes
kausheya aren’t you bengali wtf
yes
yes
Can't look smart when you tell your relatives that you study in iiith and they say "iit Hyderabad?" and you have to correct them and they look at you like you're fucking retard
canon event
who studies in IIT Hyderabad anyway isn't that the clg with frog in their biriyani
yeah i remember, during batch trip i just told some random stranger that i am from iiith and they felt un-impressed and were mumbling among themselves that this might be some random colleges here
Especially more infuriating consider I live near that fucking ass college and that's the only "good" college they've heard of apart from iits and nits
or PES uwu PES >> IIITH guys
Our college so irrelevant that even the slander has no idea we exist
U forgot abt SRM and Amritha
Swear my mom was scolding me saying no one in relatives knows IIIT
Mate wot? She's scolding you coz you're relatives are stupid?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lmao
i am fortunate that my relatives actually dont mind anything. (for them, going to some big cities to study is a lot of pride for them to brag about)
The issue is my mom wanted me to get big IIT CSE
Which didnt happen
So yeah
Keeps reminding me how I fucked up ADV
It's all over now what is complaining even gonna do man
Swear ikr
And iiit ain't even a small college we got jee toppers who rejected iits for this (I am not dickriding iiit I am saying this for the sake of argument)
Well yes
Lowkey tired of everything icl
ew iiit fan spotted yuck
Guys can we use ChatGPT in ISS quiz if we state our usage properly 🥺🥺

Yeah 😔
strike down 🙏
How bad?
Wheelchair
bro if he pauses talking to glare at someone for 30 seconds who glances in the DIRECTION of their phone
tu to mat bol maine dekh liya tha
Lmao
kya dekhlia aisa😭
No empathy
It's not funny bro wtf
90 mins of doomscrolling
technically 60
i joined in 30 mins late
Are you guys being serious, or are you being funny?
Real
bkl😭😭😭😭
Serious
valid tho
bro he’s so ASS
Oh, that's sad
he made two jokes today tho so that’s an improvement 😍
man we have two ends of the spectrum in kavita and siddhartha
one is hitler and one is a stand up comedian
neither teaches properly 💀
im not sure which is which
kavita vemuri as in the iot prof?
Tbh Siddharth teach properly in sec b
I'm so cooked, I pulled an all nighter and I could barely stay awake in linis class, I am gonna knock out within the first two minutes of siddharthas clas
@secB ppl Was there a DSA quiz tdy?
yes
Nah
Lite
Nigga atleast i understand the mojority of  what he is teaching unlike cso or iot
he teaches well, he’s just so boring and monotonous and cares tm ab people movinf
I used to understand what he was saying until like 2 classes ago, where he just started yapping and I had no fucking idea what he was saying
if you focus you’ll understand but he makes focusing so hard
Lol
Idc if cso and iot profs are "bad" they're lite and so is their subject, it's not that big of a deal
Nigga  have u seen the no of non ug1 in cso
cso is 4 creds lil bro
no that’s cus they have it then
not cus they failed it
Oo
Siddhartha forces you to pay attention when you can't understand shit and its just painful
thats because cnd and chd have it in 2nd year
Horrible policy
Even lini
The subject itself isn't that bad
lini doesnt care as much
It's understandable if u self study
Tbf he lets u go for a walk tho
?? lini is the only genuinely good prof csx has
Bro what? I am always in a tense in her class and try to avoid eye contact with mam just to prevent her from pointing me out
Atleast lining teaches well and I don't mind paying attention, Siddhartha is literal torture
Ya she teaches well I'm not saying she doesn't. But I don't understand why we're being forced to pay attention
i feel like das would be good if he focused on teaching
H is fed up with college
If we don't pay attention it's our loss were adults now not sm babies
i mean i think it’s cus of how many people failed dsa last year lol
yeah and if he had an adderall before coming
They might have looked at our cpro grades da
Lini isn't as overbearing as siddhartha
So are we, we still have to study
buddy if you’re alr fed up i have some bad news for you
Ik ik cut the lecture blah blah blah it's gonna get harder and all
Lining
wasn't that a prof skill issue
Yeah
The prof did some shitty grading
Anyway linis gonna be teaching only for next class ryt

HOLY FUCK THIS CLASS WAS TORTURE
??
I missed it bcoz I overslept what happened
told y’all
Oh Sec B Sid
👍
Lol what happened
Id like to quote two lines Siddartha Das said today
*If you don't know what you are, just remember we are all vectors*
All nighter + siddhartha class + forcing myself to stay awake but not quite really so I'm in this state of limbo where I have no idea if I'm awake or not while having my brain forcefully open my eyes to keep watch of siddhartha so he doesn't ask me shit
*Isn't this field very exciting* (saying this making the grumpiest face)
Oof 1/28/25, 1:01 PM - Ayush: True
DSA slip test on 7th for BST
Istg all nighters ain't that bad but holy fuck the classes are painful
After I leave the class I feel awake as fuck
for bst or till bst?

does dsa lab attendance matter
Same question, I'd rather grind ISS
@mps any idea

shanty mentioned 🔥🔥🔥
hamari same branch nhi thi?
general bhai
we are united in bengal hate
i didn't have shantanav he doesn't deserve any slander from what i've heard tho'
I am a very normal bengali person... 😌
shanty only good prof last sem
oxymoron
Deshpande
he bored me
yep he was one of the better ones but aftab +++
But he taught well
And his papers were good (altho shitty for those who had to solve em)
but he did bad grading
so balances things out
Ra grading was decent afaik
I don't remember tbh i've erased sem 1 from my memory
I mean its not bad consoderin the number of people with high scores (not bash me  i missed A by few decimals)
prof is fine he has a problem with sir
Noise pollution
K A N N A N
No shantanav better
your family will be found dead if you repeat such a blasphemous statement.
U too
Kannan op.
So basically
Ds profs op
Shomu peak
no way
he only taught to the first 2 benches 😭
he was not even audible in the back rows
Niga you sat last bench
Not his issue
shomu is goated tho 🙏
Thank you
Nigga u sit last bench and scroll reels means what'll he do da paapa
Exactly da
First benches get filled in seconds

😂😂
Do your job of being taught :<
Nah nah straight from heart I'm speaking trust
Skull issue bhai
Nigga do ur job of listening in class da
Yoo can anyone lend me like 3-4 safety pins
Like sankalp so kassi he shows up early for a class he doesn't even have just for first bench
*used to
But yeah, it was fun back in 1-1 RA lite
Why
Bed tactics
Yeah now u just go to the front bench for classes u actually have
Sadge, ik :(
Will the acad office be open rn?
when is iss exam timings?
Ig from 2:00 ya 2:30 to 5:00
2-5
That was peak sid moment
Let's fucking goooo
Tho does that extend to Thursday?
Coz technically there's no exam that day
But it's in the middle
Doubt It says from 30th
Thursday is 30th tho?
And we actually have quizzes on Friday and Saturday, so 🤷
Is it? Idk
Apparently it is, hmm Interesting
Brother
Didn't he say 1947 or smthg
Should be, yes
Right, mb
Lovely, thanks a bunch
Did you get the reference he made, Sai 💀
Yes I did
Let me cross check though
Hopefully
Regardless, if it's nitpicking that we wish to do, then neither date is related to the Non Cooperation movement 🤷
It is the year india gained independence -_-
But Quit India != Non Cooperation  :'(
Ok confirmed no lab on friday
Wonderful news 1/28/25, 2:08 PM - Poonam: let's go 1/28/25, 2:09 PM - Poonam: the other grp didn't have to go thru the chopella bs we did
Wait they didn't?? 1/28/25, 2:09 PM - Poonam: no 1/28/25, 2:09 PM - Poonam: pretty sure
Wtfffffff
Bro
That's
Criminal 1/28/25, 2:10 PM - Poonam: they scrapped the chopella thing and went to c a while after our lab
Lol ya
nigga
it was ONE lab
acting like he murdered your family
Yeah but tbf it did take up a slot of our upgraded labs
the questions are there to practice…
U weren't there, can't comment
they’re uploaded bruh 1/28/25, 2:42 PM - Poonam: would've been easier to forgive bro 1/28/25, 2:43 PM - Poonam: unspeakable horrors were committed that lab
Werent u litr asleep tho
me when i’m in a bitch unnecessarily contest and my opponent is section B niggas
U were knocked out tf u mean 1/28/25, 2:45 PM - Poonam: my neck was dying after I woke up
Honestly thats your skill issue
Take care of your health. Quiz is just for you to analyse your learning from this course.  
like he cares whether we get an A or D💀
Health in an engineering college 🤣
Lmao not the quiz bit rhe take care of your health bit
The quiz thing is a standard thing all the profs say 😭
Health is always a priority, with the exceptions of exams grinding all nighters ftw
Yeah, he must pity all those who keep coughing in his class. He isn't wholly rotten either,at least in section B
sorry to bring dsa here but in 5th question, it is not compulsory to do only with linked lists ryt
or do we have to use linked lists for the creation of the sparse matrix?
Yes
new scheudle
@919871431209
iot shifted from friday to thursday
What the fuck IOT paper is day after tomorrow uh what the actual fuck
Guys how the fuck do I study for IoT exan
simple
dont
:)
why wld they just change iot like that wtf😭
😔
First time they're rescheduling exams man 😔
Lite better than having it share a date with la
...pehle cso tha ab iot hai what's the difference 💀💀 just change the subject u had to study
true
what time is the quiz tmrw?
During the lab
First 1.5 hours is some sort of lecture
Then 15 mins break
And then the exam
do we have to take our laptops n stuff?
Or so the prof says in his mail
Has all this PCBs, SoCs, MCUs, FreeRTOS shit been taught in class
IoT
Tf are those words
EXACTLY
Won't it be super easy to cheat tho
For
?
ISS paper da tomorrows
Ah
Lite
Why did I pull an all nighter man fuck
Who asked for an extension?
I mean, doesn't it make more sense to have saved that card to play it when the whole batch needs it and thing?
feb 2nd damn 💀
Oh yeah
Why was it even extended 😭😭
Man i was cramming my head for last two days to finish q5 and some random dudes asks for extension... wtf bro  this is just the first assignment..
I agree
We had 2 weeks man 💀
I feel bad for my roomie who did not slept yesterday and skipped today's class for this shit
i mean
same argument goes the other way
if you had 2 weeks why didnt you do it earlier
why were you cramming it now
I had a skill issue in solving and tool longer than expected?
doesnt make sense for a deadline extension tho
the people who are going to be solving it during the deadline are anyways losing quiz prep time
you can focus on quiz now
Yeah advantage lol
Idk if I should now focus on quiz or sleeping
Sleep >
Sleep -> brain ok -> common sense regained -> ace exam with common sense
Think exam is based on common sense -> fail exam coz sir will prolly decide to ask theory based questions
Lets assume u prefer to study instead of healthy sleep, so during exam (no matter thoery or prac), u will feel sleepy -> bad concentration -> bad exam
Can't feel sleepy in an exam with all that stress and tension
I think i am the only nigga who gets sleepy no matter how tense it is 1/28/25, 7:17 PM - Sarah Roomi: @919910097808 "I've played these games before!!"
lmaooooo
i asked a ta, apparently lots of ppl complained that because of the continuous revisions in the writeup they had less days to complete and so they're giving an extension
Even the iss assignment 3rd problem is a squid game reference (red light green light mentioned, no I do not need help)
there were 3 revisions lol
ik lmao
😭
Guys can we use man page for tomorrow's quiz?
Its silly to remember all options for each grep awk sed
MAN <COMMAND>
we only have echo, read, grep, awk, sed for tomorrow ryt?
wait srsly?
idk bro that's why im asking.😭
i think few other misc commands sir gave in workbook might come?
😕
would be better if you asked in the other group w the TA's
I was under the impression sir was chill with LLMs
I'm so confused is it practical or written
😭😭😭😭😭
Isn't it pen and paper?
I'm gonna cry
also isnt it completely closed book like no laptops out on the table
bash commands WRITTEN? HELL NAW, ima rather skip.  what's the weightage?
It's objective type
there are a lot of commands, outputs and other stuff to remember idk how they'll conduct 😭 has anyone asked TAs about this?
idts llms would be allowed in quiz 😭
Atleast they should allow documentation
if they allow laptop access
Yeah
bro its a paper quiz wym laptops allowed lfmao
its an mcq one word quiz
we dont even have to write out code
granted i despise bash but like they could not be easier on us if they tried
Bro its not about code its about using the right option (-o -i -h theres a lot more)
If u know how to use it  even weiting big ass code is easy
yeah but it wont go outside what weve done or whats on his site
The grep awk sed is not propwrly given in his notes
Other things are easy
thoda to khud karle bhai 💀
Thats the tougher thing bro
dekh if we get fucked everyone except like 4 people is fucked regardless
One line answers too And we know how Girish played with those 💀
also we have class tmr right no change on that front?
No (for sec b)
ok bro
good for you
Guys is SQL coming?
Naur
No
i aspire to be this carefree
What can I say
Wait what's coming for tomrs quiz
And where to study from
And what
And when
2 to 5?
everything in bash
Bash
330-4ish itll start
serciiit.gitbook.io
45 mins during lab
Wat💀💀 The workbook is like 8 lakh pages long no
First 1.5 hours is for a class
Lite
Then 15 mins break
Just read the shell part from it
That only is 600000 pages da Ill diee
Wait what's all the material we have-
did he optimize the content on the site? i remember the layout being different
That's a different site altogether
Same stuff tho
ah okay
which one is better
Yeah that's what I got confused on
One is hosted on the SERC Gitbook, and the other on his own
They are exact same
Except the fact that his own has two pages but the same content is in one page on serciiit one
Do we have regular ISS class tomorrow morning?
so far as we know, yes
ISS is from 2:00 ryt ???
So we have the serc page and the slides thassal no
They won't ask SQL no
….?
Venue is respective sections only ??
H105 no
Yeah 1/28/25, 10:15 PM - Moksha😎: Is anyone else experiencing issues with IIIT WiFi not working?
REGISTER FOR DeccanCTF
woah guys i managed to actually do smthg I said I'd do (albeit way later 😭)  https://github.com/Neriums05/IIIT_Stuff.git  Best used as supplement to Aaryan Shah notes I suppose (DSA + LA till today is up)(ignore the doodles :<)
Do we have iss class tomorrow
yes
Wtf😭😭
i mean we havent been told we dont have one
Yea tru
do we have arts 😔
only class thats cancelled is dsa and iot right
tomorrow? yes
not on saturday though
ew
Whattt waittttt
ask your prof to make an exemption if they can
yes but quiz 1 doesnt officially start tmr
it does on thursday
official dates are 30 jan to 1 feb
only between those dates are these things cancelled
so iot lab, dsa lab for section b, iot class
dsa cancelled?
and dsa (i think)
i remember lini saying that but i might be tripping
she mightve been talking about lab
she said we'll have class at 11.3p
oh hmmm
ew
She did say..but it's gonna be a gdb sesh
how tho
u have la quiz na
or do u just have it with us
No
We have la at 8.30
and then dsa is also combined(?)
ure section A...?
since when...
no
😭
SecB also 8.30 LA in sh2
Is what das said
Iiirc
Idk I was half asleep in his class today
yeah that’ll be quiz no
how can both sections have the same class under the same prof at the same time 💀
Yes
Quiz
how will you have dsa at 11:30 if we have it then
that’s what i’m asking
idk😭😭😭
😑
On 31st Jan, both sections will have classes from 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM. Gdb, debugging, and, if time permits, assignment 1 solution will be discussed. Attendance will taken as usual.
Online / H205
Moodle post
also will we have dsa lab this Friday?
Section B
painting peeps can leave after half an hour but the class is there
i just texted tapasi ma'am abt it
hasnt assignment 1 been extended till 2nd?
how'll they discuss
shhh it’s iiit you’re not supposed to think too much ❤️
I mean this announcement came before the extension
using your common sense is a crime
Guys for ISIS its just bash right?
None of the theory from first class?
🤨
Terrorism ftw
W statement
Also it's just the stuff in his workbook?? No specific stuff regarding grep awk sed etc?
Its better to go through grep awk sed
😭
What all should i go through then
The workbook + the lab slides?
:(){:|:&};:  try this in shell
Yes I agree
What the fuck
Nice one but everyone remember python tutorials
lol
Gave me syntax error
where did u try it?
Let me try
Terminal?
linux/unix
Yep
Room aaja
Lab slides?
Send
Same 😢
Is IMS down
Doesn't load for me
> :(){ :|:& };: Do it at your own risk
Boring, didn't even use half the CPU
Koi na sanyam bhai try this  [ $[$RANDOM%6]==0] && rm -rf /|| echo Click
bruh
See, it won't affect my computer, WSL :)
yeah i try that fork momb in my vm
Fuck how do I stop whatever it is
close terminal
power cycle lol
Irony is you can't
Easiest is to force restart
the workbook has some stuff with that in lab activities section
all that will probably come
Yeah my system is fine now lol
Uske github pe hai
imagine iss tas run our scripts to check  and some mf put this kind of shit code to their code
for (( i=0; i<1000; i++ )){ cat /dev/random > /dev/null & }
This command made my computer's fans properly turn up for the first time
Try it, some computers might not be affected though
The above command was on the ISS website. They were one step ahead.
Damnn
damn ppl are calling mess system 'barbaric'
tbf a 'system' being barbaric is kinda paradoxical
barb mentioned
Why though
a system isn't meant to be uncontrolled
if it is that way, it defeats the purpose of having it in the first place
Sure but it could be in place to intentionally make people suffer
crazy (thats already happening)
yep you've got a pt. i retract my statement (it's too technical lol)
Do we need id card ?
With regards to today's iss quiz
Easiest paper in last 8 years
Whoa
With regards to ISIS
ISIS?💣💥
Good Afternoon everyone  We are writing this email to mention some points regarding yuktahaar mess.  1.Please maintain queue system : Yesterday it is observed that many people are taking idli and roti without being in the queue. It hardly takes 5 more minutes to get your turn. To solve this problem, we are providing two counters for idli.  2.Route: As kadamb mess work is going on the route going to yuktahaar mess is changed. The new route is on the way going to badminton court of Kadamb.  3.Reporting:If you face any issue in yuktahaar first approach the staff, if not resolved there is a feedback register(will check by committee members regularly) and WhatsApp group to approach the committee.  4.Closing the lids: It is observed that many people are not closing the lids on the food containers. You have to take again from the same containers. So please all containers with lids after usage.  5.Shoe racks: Please use the shoe racks to keep your footwear. Tell us if you any objection regarding this and we are open to take any crazy ideas to implement this.  Thank you Yuktahaar committee
YUKTAHAAR MENTIONED 🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞WTF IS EDIBLE FOOD 🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞

How dare you let me rage in peace
(Our IoT prof's a Gunslinger)
Call American dasas to fight back
how many people was i accused of murdering on november 24 1992 ⁉️
0‼️
Kavita lowkey badass but she really puts the bad in teaching
It's just guided yapping guys dw

😭😭😭😭😭
I couldnt phrase it properly 😭😭😭😭
I can frame quiz questions properly unlike Sai today so participate in TVRQC MELA Quiz when we have it :)
Wtaf is iot
This is  so fascinating
IOT ITS NOT JUST A IOT IOT IS A BRAND IOT IS THE MAN OF THE SMART PEOPLE THE PEOPLE OF IOT THEY ARE VERY SMART
(the people of IoT carry shady firearms)
I got a glock in my rari
I put the new forgis on the jeep
OMG YES THE QNS WERE SO BADLY FRAMED 😭
It's guided yapping
Everything in this college is guided yapping, remember Spatial thinking?
no
I don't :P
Rajan++
Those days
The days before stp was just like this 💀💀
But 10x worse
genuinely
no idea of the syllabus
no idea of the question paper
no idea of your prep level
no resources either 😂
just a trip to Yaptown
at least we have book this time
Fun times
One of the tas said we'll have lab content aswell 😭
Stp endsem was so nice
oh hell naawwww
Exactly
And dude did good grading, so all forgiven
Yes that's why it was nice
Yeah
Yeah now I actually have to lock in
Have no idea what happened in half of the labs
Exactly so attend MELA quiz
:3
WE DO?!
The fuck is the iot book

We have one

iits on moodle
My bad, I havent opened it yet
Slides better tbh
ooh

Thats just the first one frm KV
Yes, the slides are a bit brief
Im just pushing all the topics into chatgpt to further explain :)
(Frm the slides)

Alr then ig I'll just learn it for the first time
Since it's mcq type I'm just fast forwarding half of this shit
ITS MCQ TYPE

good morning
Yea
BRO WHAT NAH WHY TF DID I
BRUH
BYE
WHEN DID WE GET THIS INFO THO
in last class
Cheer up idk what you studied but it'll prolly be useful when we have descriptive in midsems
almost the entire first pdf I memorized
Ouch like you actually memorised the whole thing?
yeah almost
Holy fuck
Like
How?
bro good only
she might ask some shit qsn like in iss
idk I just ... did
itll be good if yk all that stuff
icba now f this shit
Bro is gonna top iot
Easy 10 cg
💀
Bro overprepared so much that he had to nerf himself
real shit
do we have to do the textbook?
what chapters if so?
Only the first iirc?
chapter 3 from the pdf isn't done ryt?
he taught only till mcus no
Does this mean there is no class ??
Cso??
No this is for iot
It was before they changed dates
Iot has no class
Okay cool
It is told by ta s in group
Where is sh3??
So sad
Modern sensors or the architecture one??
Is there cso class today?
Yup
Inside cqst
Go a floor above sh2 and then walk straight to the end
tHIS IS CONFIRMED RIGHT?
Yes 👍
why reply so fast ?
On phone constantly :)
don't you have 300 slides to study ?
Each slide take 1 sec to read
I am also sitting in first row of cso class and doing wa
xDxD
Tf is wa
See the thing is I'm not touching that subject anymore let wtv happen now
WhatsApp man
Doomscrolling prepared me for this moment
prof is right in front of me  lol
Doing it in front of this prof ain't a challenge go do it on front of siddhartha then start flexing
Siddhartha is just a chill guy with an inability to express emotions on his face
He has the best humour
"He's just a chill guy" brother he spends half of the class harassing random students who dared to look away for one second
he is doing bakchodi with you guys
be happy :)
Bait used to be believable
Where exactly is SH3
Platform 9 3/4 🧙🏻‍♂️✨
go towards sh2, then go up the stairs near the filter, then go inside cqst and on the right side there'll be sh3
oooo
Are you certain? @919041149109 says that his TA told him otherwise though
someone pls confirm whether we have lab tmrw or not (sec B)
Bruh obviously not
Yes
Start grinding
no
It's graded
see this is the problem one person says no another says yes
Carries 10% of our grade
Afaik yes but let me check again 😭
bro im not soo dumb to believe u i know this is an ungraded lab
and you trust joshua
i don't that's the point

No
God why
So pls let me know if saturday 2-5 is free :)

Not free not free pls
acad office said no labs
But this @917075970819
Yeah see trust the acad office
Yeah uh theres something called being a hypocrite and a twat
Sankalp can u think of a time when mps haven't lied
i mean it’s prolly an unless stated otherwise policy
"policies are just loose guidelines"
Fair enough but they'll probably keep like 2 labs next week if not tomorrow
😭 trauma
❤️❤️❤️🥺🥺🥺
they sent
Top of t-hub looking fine af
can’t
cus we have graded labs
In that note, college rules are also just loose guidelines
Rushil
Youre not Sec B
Quite litr according to *certain ppl* yes
😭
Yes
Certain ppl
CND lore drop?
No
Mp stuff :)
Mp lore ;) 1/30/25, 11:49 AM - Kartik: It is better to have lab tmrw or sat whenever Rather than have 2 labs in 1 week
Mps scamming us fr
Nah mps r the best
Brother we have cso
Yeah, except @917075970819 1/30/25, 11:50 AM - Kartik: Fine then Saturday we can keep
you… also have graded labs…
what’s your point
Sure ^ ^
Oh shit next week is graded
this fri/sat's lab is ungraded for sure right?
See I think it's time we plan another batch trip to the top of t hub
I'm talking to the ta, if we skip this sat lab, we'll be properly lagging behind and at some point they will hold a friday-saturday lab in the same week
https://youtu.be/oNz4eZ3sGXA?si=i9t1VfgEBxsxUB2C
Yes it will
We gotta study lab stuff too, for IoT?
So do you guys have anything in this saturday 2-5 slot
yes
wtf
no way
Ahh shit, here we go again...
Tho no code
ahh thank god
It's mostly the theory aspects I think
as per tas
yes
I cannot deal with that rn
I can't deal with theory 😭
Are u sure
Im scared theyre gonna pull up Arduino shut
ldr and ultrasonic sensor are in the slides too so it doesnt make that much of a difference
Rushil was the one handling vivas for me
Yes ta confirmed
Its been ONE FUCKING month and Im already so tired of ts
++
Guys 😭
Bro feels like 7 years da tf

Attendance we get uh
not everything is attedance man its charity 😭😭
Id run for charity if I got attendance da 1/30/25, 2:38 PM - Poonam: Nan what would you do if theres a sick dying child on the road but you don't get sports attendance for helping 😔
"Id work for free if I got money da"
Ok but getting attendance doesn't harm the cause
Did u really compare me asking for attendance to me asking for MONEY
it doesn't harm the pec people to give out attendance of it'll help some kids nod
If u can't get the analogy then it's not my fault 💀
Victim blaming is wild
Being called the victim is wild
@debsoc guys if this turns into a heated debate please don't start advertising
I left debsoc dw
I had a personal clash with one of its members
Couldn't be resolved
😂😂😂
Sadly I had to leave
Not naming names but
~rushil~
started w an r and ended w a l fr
💀💀💀💀💀💀
Holy cow⁉️
Maybe if ur analogy made any sense then we wouldn't be in this position💀
Oof :(
r/im14andthisisdeep
It's a sensitive topic
"I couldn't understand not cuz I'm dumb but prolly cuz your dumb"
Ok nan
I understand
Tbf if u want me to get technical Ur in the wrong here I'm ok w elaborating if u want
Arya vs nan going crazy
The point of charity is to do it if you want and selflessly .. the whole point of her argument is will we get attendance which isn't selfless so I may be wrong in this but I'm not in the whole "i want attendance" cuz it's called charity for a reason 💀
The point of charity is not selflessness  Charity can have selfish roots Why do u think MNCs or billionaires donate  Truly out of the goodness of their heart? Or incentives   Incentives like Social image Media recognition Tax exemptions
Charity is defined by outcome and not intentions  I'm p sure nobody has purely selfless intentions in mind
hey guys join debsoc!
Oh dear god...
LMAO
😭😭
Attendance doesn't negate the benefit of charity It's simply an incentive And in fact if the incentive motivates more PPL to participate and contribute then one could argue that it literally enhances and amplifies the charity by creating outreach and motivation
Tata just have away 108 billion dollars? He would have gotten yhr same image with giving away 20 billion or 30 billion dollars. So
Arya look at Musk
Selflessness is not a requirement for charity
Pretty sure if the outcome was to get people to join, they wouldn't call it charity in the first place
U can help ppl and be a shitty person on the inside
And vice versa
Hes donated like $2B
??????
People to join the charity event
And hes still a fucking twat I wanna punch
I LITERALLY ASKED LIKE, NO
More incentives = more funds raised = greater cause
Oh my god you have 0 logical arguments da just spamming sass doesn't make u sound cool like u think it does😭
Don't most of you guys have an exam in like 55 mins? Why are you guys here 💀
I think its the first time Joshua isn't in the debate :) (I THINK)
guys can we have this debate after iot ☹️
I also wanna participate
Gettout nan wins anyday iot is nerfing me
Nan talking about spam and sass is crazy
Mf watchu say?
lmfao mf get in then
Padhke aundhe padhgaye
Working for free for money is a direct paradox    That completely contradicts the meaning of the word free   Whereas in nans argument, incentive of attendance did not tamper the meaning of the concept of charity   Whether ur point is morally right or wrong, your analogy was fallacious as fuck
Iot lite man we don't even know what to study anyways
💀💀💀 Why should I be the only one who does it selflessly? This is like saying don't give the blood donors biscuits and juice because they should wanna do it _selflessly_
I'll proxy dw
Nah I'm just here to bakchod
Do u disagree?
Nigga if by giving attendance more people participate in a charity run then why not? Whats the con here?
No im just overwhelmed by all this debate shii
It isn't a requirement agreed but its the point of a charity that's why it's called a charity the whole point of doing something for someone without any personal benefit is called charity but wtv mahn look it how you will
like, chill out.....fr
If the personal benefit doesn't take away from the cause What's wrong with that?
Arya are you just debating this random aah topic where there is a clear correct side because u wanna feel like your opinion is heavy and cool💀
Good things without bad things = good things
Good things are good
I don't see
The issue
We get attendance Little kids get saved
Nah you argue for cool lmao go study iot
💀💀💀💀 DAFUUUUUUQ
Everyone's happy
Ok da don't repeat my point now tf u doin😭
i didn't know people went to blood donation camps for the biscuit and juice news to me
++++
They don't, but an incentive like that is nice isn't it? 1/30/25, 3:08 PM - Poonam: that is wild bro
The point is  I highly doubt ppl in need care about the deep rooted intentions behind the charity
You misunderstood my point da😭 Read again once plej
they're given biscuits and juice so that they don't fucking faint 💀 it's still selfless on their part
This is 10/10 line
In this case, its not the college organizing this afaik, and hence, the college cannot give incentives If the people are interested in doing "charity", then they ought to participate Expecting the college to give handouts is, well, insane
That's what I'm saying asking for it isn't bad, you can and should ask for it but if you don't get what you want and then you don't do it, that's wrong na
Exactly my point thank you
Why is that wrong- Wanting to do good so that good happens to you is not wrong at all. In fact that's the most evolutionary basic human instinct ever no
I'll give da
If an influencer is donating food for clout  Then let him At the end of the day The people in need are getting food  Whether he was selfless or not Doesn't matter to them Why do we care? Cuz were privileged enough to be able to debate the motives behind an action  Debating philosophy of charity is a luxury But it shouldn't come in the way of the deed itself
there's no con if they did it themselves, his argument (im assuming) is you shouldn't be asking for an incentive to do a good thing, either do it or don't ask it seems insensitive
It's a hypothetical
No, I am saying that because the college is advertising it, maybe it can play a part in supporting it as well? Like how it's supporting the hyd marathon by giving people attendance and thereby increasing participation, maybe it can do that here as well?
the important part is youre asking, regardless of whether there is an incentive or not
Why shouldn't u ask for an incentive to do something good what- I mean the fact that I'm willing to do good itself is a plus point on my belt no?
Surely even in a hypothetical sense, questioning the college (or the authorities or whatever) and judging them for the fact that they aren't giving out freebies is kinda wrong?
There is nothing wrong with hoping good happens to those who do good, on a fundamental level
As a society we tend to nitpick on tiny things like political correctness or genuine mistakes that do not actually affect the people in need
that's not for me to debate whether its fundamentally right or wrong, but in public perception it just seems insensitive that's all
++ exactly, the ultimate goal here is to help the children. If by giving attendance more children are protected then what's the harm
also yeah agreed
In my opinion  Again, just my two cents  Public is selfish We like to think we're doing something real by making sweet statements or calling out 'insensitive' opinions to give us the guise of action when we are participating in inaction It's a social performance to make us feel better about ourselves
For the one reason that society believes that a person who is doing good is not doing so out of personal interests, but rather because they actually want to make a difference If they get any benefit in the process, its good for them
....defeats the point of it being called a charity...if you wanna run for attendance then go Noones stopping you but if you wanna portrait it as a charity event, and then you proceed to ask if there is attendance and then you dont go when you dont get it, moots the point of it being a charity. There is money raised when people go on marathons without it being called a charity event. If it is charity, then you getting something in return shouldn't be a factor in deciding if you wanna participate or not is all my point is
Well my point could have also been to promote the fact that giving attendance brings people. Maybe I was trying to promote the event as a whole by bringing attention of the masses to it. To simply villainize me for such an attempt is cruel😞😞😞
She never said she won't run if there's no attendance She simply asked if there would be
Cmon u want me to believe that?
I don't think you're right in assigning malicious undertones to her statement
Ask her itself
yeah but if it’s already social performance you asking for an incentive/ personal gain waters it down further
that is your opinion and you are welcome to it but im just saying how it comes out to anyone
It's a sports event  It's a reasonable assumption
Ik ik
That's not what I meant
Dm
Now that this is no longer hypothetical It is not a IIIT organized event It is hence not a reasonable assumption?
How the fuck is giving attendance going against the rules of charity? Them giving attendance to us is also charity in one way if you think about it. When on earth did I say that I would ONLY participate if attendance was being rewarded?
I wasn't aware of that  Idek what the event is but I'm fairly certain she had no malintent
Are you going be running 10k on the other marathon?
The marathon that you guys had brought up earlier is actually organised by the Sports Council along with the college itself, so they can afford to give out attendances so that people show up
The hyderabad marathon shit is not IIIT organized either. The marathon before that was not IIIT organized either. Awarding attendance for physical activity is something that has been promoted for a long time now, by the college itself. So yes, it's a reasonable assumption
Yeah lmao I filled da
The one slated for the next weekend? It is organized by the college, at least by the looks of their mail/poster
AYOOO SO MANY PEOPLE DEBATING
Guys guys pull up to shots fired group guys😀😀😀😀😀
it’s the same 5 as last time😭
Don't
I'm anti debsoc
Omfg
????
kicking u out of mun
I want to try yes, but I really don't think I can. If I could I most most most definitely would
BABAM it's always debsoc marketing uwu
I literally asked for this not to happen
I agree
young man discovers free will
Please
https://mindingourway.com/altruistic-motivations/
Ahhh
very interesting read on this very topic
Arya this is turning from less of a general philosophical discourse into more of a personal attack
i remember reading it a few years back
Gettout joshua detected opinion rejected
basically all your arguments summarized
Very unnecessary asw
(both sides)
I wanna know if 3 attendances / 6 attendances was a factor that's all
💀💀💀 What I want attendance + I want to try. Your point being?
Why
I'm sorry if that's lead to being personal or wtv
Yeah why this nigga targetting I'll start targetting too uh💀
Yeah it was
I can't believe I'm saying this but go focus on Iot guys holy shit or just continue in the debsoc group
Genuinely why
It obviously was
pratyush
how is this altruistic though?
BRO iot gone I gave up I'm becoming politician instead
This being the answer
thats the point
What's that
Oooo
selfless concern for the benefit of others
theres a specific thing im trying to find one sec
Ok
Even I've given up on becoming an engineer I'm just aiming to become a pani puri seller doesn't mean I shouldn't do shit before an exam
Yo open new stall in iiit
Fucker u do this shit 24/7 if I dog lil on the group you'll sock uh😭
Pls pls
Rules for thee and not for me
Ayo who is the black one here
Exactly shush
https://mindingourway.com/on-caring/ @917976344711 more accurate i suppose
Okay but inherently there are very few people in the world who do good out of no personal agenda. At the very least, the idea of karma is at the back of their minds. The idea that "if I do good good happens to me" is embedded within every person I'd say, just from an evolutionary perspective
section 3 is the relevant portion if you want to skip ahead its a small read
tangential but yes
I like this part
"Small read" yeah no I wouldn't trust a kassi on this
Nate Soares is amazing
It probably feels better to safe one life than say a hundred ngl
Yes, but society has also deemed it uncouth to voice the idea, even though it is in every single one of us (Blindly posturing? Maybe)
I feel like that's true for the opposite as well. Maybe hurting one person feels worse than hurting a hundred? Maybe because the effect dies down?
Society lite what even is a society thu WHAT DOES ANY OF THIS HAVE TO DO WITH ATTENDANCE
I'll run 10km if they give attendance
Idk why this makes me wanna do ug1 vs nagraju debate on tyranny and dictatorship 💀 (of pec)
How the fuck have yall managed to blow up asking for attendance into such a heated debate man what the fuck I ain't built for this deep shit
And I believe that most of us have been socially conditioned to view such an open show of interests in a bad light, which was the cause of all this imo
I just wanted attendance da😭
more likely so because you don't see the effects of hurting a hundred people in your face (probably)
while with one person you definetly do
anyways IoT bye
Who tf is viewing that in a bad light nigga how high is yallss moral compass
Like why yall overthinking this shit I prolly sound like an ass and an ignoramus but come on
Somebody realised this finally lmao Have fun and atb for iot guys
I've been reading Iot in the backround lmao
I just put it out as a plausible explanation for the same
Must be fun to have to give an exam for IOT lol
No no even then Imagine a dungeon with one bro getting horribly tortured And another with a hundred people getting horribly tortured  I feel like I would be more KAKSSHSHAKLA seeing the first case
any LA assignment this week?
Not in section B
haa toh there is none then
😂
WHAT THE FUCK 1/30/25, 3:32 PM - Poonam: Biometric machine dangling in front of your face 😔

EXCUSE ME WHAT THE FUCK⁉️
Iot
crazy
Bro at least he told u zia was like he'll see

what the actual fuck man
Like what do I do with this information
LMFAOOOOOOOO
AHHH WHY LIKE BEFORE THE FUCKING EXAM MAN
AHHHH
AAARRGHH
Isn't the exam like in half an hour
atleast this means that the quiz is mcq

This shit has to be illegal man they can't just spring this on us like half an hour before the exam
Ofc there was a twist 😭😭
What time zone are you living in
*25
uhh its at 4 na
I wanna kms so bad rn
4 is a social construct
Ahh
Man dont bring this trauma
man they gotta stop giving us info at the last moment 😭
we asked so much times yesterday they could've fucking said something no
Istg man what is this retarded ass behaviour
Time to speedrun revision
It's all in your mind, guys. IoT does not exist, it can't hurt y'all
Iot is a social construct

Man
Where were the questions about Kavita having suspicious firearms
What firearms? There are no firearms in ba sing se
This fucking shit is bringing me closer to the prospect of driving off a cliff
Why the hell was the actual syllabus never clarified
Why was the format of the question not clarified until fifteen minutes INTO THE EXAM
Why was the exam in the middle of fuckall nowherr
Why was the exam 7.5 marks and thus each MCQ was 0.5% of the grade
I know people whove missed out on a higher grade by 0.5%
Why the hell was half the paper lab based and there never was a official clarification about whether lab was coming or not
Twats
_Everything covered in the class and in labs_ This is the answer we got from profs
.
Never mind
The lab part for pull up pull down resistor kinda ass bruh the way I implemented it was different from what was asked like tf is this shit

LESGO
is calculator allowed for tmrw's exam?
Dont u feel ashamed asking this while being an asian
its gonna take more effort to enter the numbers than calculate by hand surely
everything done in class before vector space is part of the syllabus right?
Ye
why are there so few msgs here...🤔🤔 ?
most kassi batch fr 😭😭😭
Everyone tryna study for la
I'm just trying not to fail man
is invertible matrix part of the syllabus??
Yes
Start grinding lil bro
invert karna sikhaya toh naho h usne
so the entire chap 1 in the tb?
cool
Yes
haan basically how do you get identity using elementary row operations, then find the elementary matrix of those operations
?
nvm i framed it like a q -_-
was explaining how to get
acha
On moodle btw
wot
what
Wait lemme edit that one i framed it while high
W
haan basically get identity matrix using elementary row operations, then find the elementary matrix of those operations
Ok everyone go kassi la now
It's cool but I still don't like the guy let me sleep in class if I ain't understanding shit anyways
There's still 7 hours left
Ye exactly
Go kassi now so you can sleep
Bro watched one piece he doesn't know what sleep is
Any time spent sleepin is time wasted on revision
Sure
Exactky
It says PM
Who even has the energy to watch one piece man that's the only anime which had me like "fuck no i'd rather read the manga"
Oh wait it does 😭
Unfortunate
Its PM not AM
Issok we'll imagine it's am
Gonna pass la for sure tomorrow guys 👍
Kassi
I'm just blasting random music in my ears to keep myself awake and stimulated
he's sleeping nicely while letting us suffer 🥰
What the fuck is a healthy sleep schedule⁉️
siddhartha seems to know
He's gatekeeping sleep
real
he shld let us sleep in class man
He doesn't like it when others sleep more than him
If I can’t talk to my friends in class then you shouldn’t too …
How can a field contain 0 and 1 without containing -1 😭 why'd this make sense to me before
If you actually said that he'd prolly respond with something cheesy like "I'm like your friend, I'll talk to you or you talk to me"
Additive inverse of 1 should exist
Which is -1
Which means if 1 is in ghe field
-1 must also be
Ye
But he said you can have a field with {0,1}
Not mine, this was his statement a few classes back
Bro
Maybe it's the way you define + and . ?
({0,1},+,•) (mod2)
Remember ds
That's what i though
I remember ds 😭👍
The goat has responded
no
you’re thinking of subfields of complex numbers
Additive inverse of 1 becomes 1
Just define it that way
every subfield of complex numbers must contain the whole set of rational numbers
but if you go outside the scope of complex numbers, and define a field with an operation which is not trivial addition or multiplication, you can have a field with just 0,1
like this^
The more I see this kassiing the more I realise how fucked I am
also 0 and 1 are just representation of identity elements
they don’t have to be the actual rational numbers 0 and 1
Exactly
Its essentially 0f and 1f
And characteristic of 1f can just be 1 if its not a characteristic zero field so 1f + 1f can be zero
Ah fair enough
Thanku
Updated my la notes to cover this as well -_- 👍
Does anyone have the shit covered in the tutorials?
The DSA class today is slated to be held at? SH-1/SH-2 or some other class?
They'll inform us i suppose
Imagine being awake this early
Hopefully before the class begins 💀

Imagine not having gone to sleep at all
I mean i have another quiz so

8 o'clock exam is crazy
Half of the batch won't even be awake to attend it
Oh yes reminds me I need to eep
Imagine having to eep
Not bad eh ill take it
So the dsa combined class... is no longer a combined class?
I'm so confused
The DSA combined class will happen in SH1 for section A, and SH2 for section B.
?
The DSA combined class will happen in SH1 for section A, and SH2 for section B.
I can read tyvm rushil 1/31/25, 11:08 AM - Poonam: how is that combined then 1/31/25, 11:08 AM - Poonam: "the dsa combined class will happen separately" 1/31/25, 11:08 AM - Poonam: 😔
It's combined in spirit
Or sh1 and sh2 can do a fusion dance
Hell naw theyre using 2009 slides for this
(THE YEAR NOT THE NUMBER)
Good that you mentioned, I was really traumatized
Guys seacc sir is sitting in the back instead of the front bench I'm scared now what have they done with him

Where is Kshitij Gajjar
Why is a TA here
He will come in the next class I think
I see
That's what Lini Ma'am told if I'm correct.
Coz lini can't be in 2 places at once
Don't underestimate
Lini ma'am best ftw
We just proved that she can in the CM quiz
What was the need for that reference 🥲
Did we?
I saw ur paper it  was trauma inducing but where exactly did u prov that 👍🏼
Cause idk what I've written in the paper
Because I skipped half the question paper
I will tell you once I understand
I proved that i can write utter bullshit if prompted in the cm exam
greeen tshirt
@MPs no attendance?
Bruh
please tell fast i’m still in obh bed is v comfy
Wtf
Recording without consent haw
Could have quoted him 😔
It's legal in India
What behaviour is this
attendance there or not
pls tell
.
Is it now?
Since the ta did not expect to be recorded then, it's not 🙂
During dsa class, just like last time
Now he'll set up a teams meet, then you can record him 👍
(I wear my green t-shirt every Friday)
Arre, it's completely legal to capture without consent to use it as proof in future
Brother it's only in public spaces where you can expect to be recorded 😭
Article 21 only limits you from recording if there is a reasonable expectation of privacy at the place and time
You can't record someone in their homes
So idk
But, it's class
But there's no cctv here
nop
Doesn't stop me from recording the seacc or being recorded myself
So no implicit assumption that someone will record you
There is a cam
Ayein?
Wait so we can leave?
Kahaan
yea
No attendance 👍
Yes
This is why sanyam said he's camping at the back to leave easily
Apparently
Mr resident cctv simp btao sh2 mai cctv hai ki nhi
Don't quote me
nhi hai
actually no attendance????
Not CCTV, it's just a camera that is used for online class
i thought he was jokin????
haa vo hai
So, technically he can be recorded
do i leave obh or not someone tell man
Brother that's not active rn and the ta didn't even know abt the fact that he had to do ms teams meet
Hebl was not expected to be though
🍿🍿🍿
Read what Sankalp sent
He was not informed he can, so it's not reasonable for him to expect to be recorded
We've told him now, so now he can expect to be recorded
IS THERE ARTENDANCEOR NOT IDGAF ABT RECORDING PPL WITH CONSENT
Ffs
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Ab tu record kar usko
No 😭
Sankalp also believes that it is not legal to record him, since he was not expecting to be recorded back then
for both sections?
This q has been answered 😭👍
Nahi, tabhi karna tha
If he's recording for lasya he consents to be recorded no matter the purpose
Is this how debsoc members behave? Tsk tsk 😂 1/31/25, 11:49 AM - Inesh Roy: Does sec A have attendance?
Should be for both sections, but only explicitly mentioned for sec b
She left 💀
Bro istg 1/31/25, 11:49 AM - Devansh 211: I think you can record and use it until you do not show it to someone he doesn't want it to be shown
😓 1/31/25, 11:49 AM - Inesh Roy: Can someone in SH1 ask 1/31/25, 11:49 AM - Devansh 211: But as it was in class he was expecting to be shown to our batch 😂😂
Bro there is no attendance in sh2 right
No attendance bro  They cant take for one section and not for the other
He wasn't informed that he had to record for lasya then, so it wasn't justified then
He is aware now, so it's justified now
😭😭😭😭😭
Omg
Ok start record him
I actually think fir once they can't use this as an excuse
Idw to????
Why would I record hin
I'm gonna record him
You can if you want to
Cool
Wouldn't you? I thought that you of all people would be interested 🤣
????
Where is this assumption coming from -_- 1/31/25, 11:52 AM - Devansh 211: Damn what 1/31/25, 11:52 AM - Devansh 211: Interested
Fuck I used the wrong you're
you're*
This i agree
See I expose myself before others can to look less stupid
Wut? Not of random profs, certainly not
only param?
Of some particular profs yes
Negation of the same
Lmaoo
Silence is sometimes the best option 💀
Nah I'd assume you're prolly staring at your kannan collection, lost in his eyes 1/31/25, 11:56 AM - Devansh 211: Yeah mind you he probably does have a kannan collection
Yes he is
@917204430421
Got a traumatising look at his kannan collection because i'm sitting next to him 😔 1/31/25, 11:56 AM - Devansh 211: Why look bro ?? 😑
And sankalp staying quiet is just proving us correct
Arre dikh gya galti se kya kru
_Kannan collection_   🫠
Time to bleach my eyes
He's too invested in his kannan collection
Ok br9
Sankalp what kinda kinky pics do u have 1/31/25, 11:58 AM - Devansh 211: What photos are you clicking joshua
Bro's building a sankalp collection
Nah that's kannans job 1/31/25, 11:59 AM - Devansh 211: Yeah now joshua wants a sankalp colection
Only collection I want is of the mp hater 1/31/25, 11:59 AM - Devansh 211: Ohhhhj

Nah bruh upload that shi
Tit for tat 1/31/25, 12:03 PM - Devansh 211: I didn't send that
Please blur out the poor fellow next to me he said he doesn't consent 1/31/25, 12:05 PM - Devansh 211: Parth lite
💀 1/31/25, 12:06 PM - Devansh 211: Yeah lil bro 😅😅 1/31/25, 12:08 PM - Devansh 211: What !??
yes.

Fuck yuktahar raah
yuktahar 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
😭😭😭😭😭😭
dsa a2 tomorrow
padhle
Unfortunately 😭
Iss a2 also coming up soon
Fuck yuktahar. Genuinely fuck yuktahar. Words cannot express how much I hate this sorry excuse of a food serving facility it is, but I will try to express just a bit of my hate with this shitty long ass message. This has got to be one of the most dogshit messes in the history of this college, and that's saying alot considering the fact there were fucking frogs in the biryani from kadamb. I had the unfortunate experience of eating at yuktahar for the first week of this godforsaken college, and it made me want to kill myself more than ra ever will. I will concede that the lunch and dinner do serve edible food (I know, I'm a very reasonable person) but the breakfast is absolutely horrendous. I don't even know if what they were serving could even be called food. I would say that it's only good point is being used as a torture mechanism, very useful for getting information out of the enemy, but its potential was wasted on torturing some innocent facchas for a week. Let me describe the 'food' they served there for breakfast for that one week. One day I saw idlis. "Oh cool idlis, a form of food I recognize!" So I plop down a few of them on my plate and start eating them. While eating it I feel some weird hard bit. Which made me feel uncomfortable because it's fucking idli it's supposed to be soft. So I decide to ignore it and have another bite. Another hard bit. I look down at my idli. THERE'S FUCKING CORN INSIDE IT. I do not know what kind of genius decided to put fucking corn in idli but that guy needs to be sentenced to a 24 hour intense CBT session, repeat if he still insists if his creation is still good. I swear to god, like just because corn tastes good and idli tastes good doesn't mean the combination of both of them will taste good. This is the same kind of logic the guy who created pineapple pizza used. Fucking dumabasses. Another day they served ragi idli which atleast can be considered as 'real' idli.  Now we have the main item which was so bad it gave me uncurable ptsd and fueled my lifelong hate of yuktahar. This brown slop they served. I do not know what it is called nor do I want to know what it is called. That shit has traumatized me for life. Fuck man I'm not even exaggerating that shit was not edible. Like literally. I could not force it down my throat because it had me gagging it right out. It's a miracle I didn't puke all over the floor. Got that was awful. I'd gag less from having a rolled up ra textbook being shoved down my throat. Genuinely one of the worst things I've experienced in my entire life, and I've stood in [REDACTED] water in obh stalls. They served that shit again (yes twice in the same week) and I, in my incredible stupidity, had somehow gaslighted myself into thinking that it was "all in my head". So I took a bit of that shit (apt description considering it's colour and taste) and gave it a second go. I took a teensy-weensy itty-bitty _tiny_ little drop on my spoon and but it in my mouth.  I almost emptied my insides out.  Yeah no fuck that shit I threw that shit away and spammed watermelons on my plate. Best fucking watermelon of my life it got me crying tears of relief  One day they served raw bread and it made me so fucking happy. Fucking raw bread. It was the best thing they had served for breakfast. The shit they served for breakfast so bad raw bread was the best thing they had.  After that one week of torture I could not change my mess fast enough. My heartiest condolences to any future facchas who have their first week of meals at this mess which even the deepest circles of hell refused, saying "it was too horrible". May God help you through those trying times.
Ug2k24 copypasta lesgo
noo not yuktahar defamation
The hate shall spread wooo

Ok man i'll shut up

who is this nigga??
go to feb 2 onwards
You can't register for today and tomorrow
click on not registered
So make sure you're in feb
Damn, Misinformation listened to the voice of the batch finally 😂 1/31/25, 10:26 PM - Krrish Gupta: valid
Not getting clicked 🤔
which day
2nd onwards it'll work
not before that
O nvm it worked thanks
@917745090290 bro is it implemented already or is it still testing time ?
Testing
There's a lot of work still pending. You can't expect them to deploy such sophisticated software in 1 week
I'm unable to click anything though @917745090290
2nd Feb check
I can select the text "Not Selected"
Yeah then select the mess👍
Ahh, it defaults to Jan for some reason
Like after scrolling it still kept me in Jan lmao
*the _text_* 1/31/25, 10:30 PM - Krrish Gupta: will there be a feature to register by days and stuff? 1/31/25, 10:30 PM - Krrish Gupta: like there was on old mess portal
That's what they are trying to implement
Mostly no since caps are there 1/31/25, 10:31 PM - Krrish Gupta: another thing : when i click on the month, it shifts a month back
It should take you back to the current month I think 1/31/25, 10:32 PM - Krrish Gupta: wait is that some feature
i think it redirects you to Jan 2025 not a month back 1/31/25, 10:32 PM - Krrish Gupta: yeah i just realised
LESGOOOOOO
If not then at least an option to copy the previous week's registration or something like that
We are trying to take the last month's registration and allow confirming it directly if seats are left
LETS GOOOOOO
this Sai seems to be a gud guy (apart from the yapping during exam)
aah it brings you to current month always
Dashed interesting
yes, there will be the ability to re-register whatever you did last day/last week
is there provision of monthly registration??
NICE
bruh you're not implementing it stop answering incorrectly
not yet, we have code for it, but we need the mess office's input on it
Ohh
So, you are saying I can register for all Mondays of the year
Please do that
also cancellations work like before only?
I'll be the happiest person
3pm the previous day? 1/31/25, 10:37 PM - Ojas Kataria: Not the frog on the QR 😭
no, I'm saying you can register for monday based on last monday's registration
nahi that is dependent on mess office policy, we don't control that
Ya, so I mentioned about monthwise later if you see
hehee :))
It's just that you are implementing weekwise
ok sir 🫡

If you jump, your head will touch the cieling
the roof of SH1 is way higher from the ground than SH3's
But there's nothing above sh3 right  Soo they could just extend the pillars and build a new roof 🥺
I love your optimism
it's not that ez bro there's a shit ton of reinforcement holding the structure together plus the building's old af
Are you describing a tunnel? Must be pretty small if _you_ touch the ceiling when you jump

Apparently someone mailed the dean complaining abt kalakshetra
I would suggest writing such mails only after taking in batch input btw
Else specify that _you_ are having an issue
It is referencing me asking for endsem (i think?) papers being rescheduled last sem :)
Oh
Ppl were ok with having multiple exams on the same day surprisingly
Ok yeah what I was thinking of was more.... domestic
Domestic 💀💀💀

Yeah we got frogs they got rats, truly a top college of India moment
Siddhartha Das' mood will still be more dead than that owner
Hi all; mess portal has been updated so you should be able to use it offline now – pls test it out (i.e. open website with internet, then turn on airplane mode and refresh - it should still show you your registrations + qr, but not let you register for new meals)  To install the website as an app, you should be able to find an "add to homescreen" or similar button in your browser.  You can also import meals from the previous day, the same day of the previous week, or just copy over the previous week into the next one!  pwease wepowt any bugs to me or vedant 👉👈  https://mess.aarnavpai.in
Oh my GOD what's with the uwu
mwess pwotaw :3
Pls do some justice to the half of this message that I crafted for you
It's okay :)
You're fowgiwen
Damn, I hope the portal itself has its fair share of uwuified content 😂
The commit messages certainly do
Any other Easter eggs other than the obvious frog?
find em yourself
Gotta catch em all 🔥🤣
just to reiterate, this is not gonna affect your actual meals btw. It's just a test instance
Your actual meals will be the ones on ims
It's not "up" up yet trust me we'd be celebrating a lot more if it was
But this is still great progress in a short amount of time, so the celebration is certainly not out of place Fine show, guys 🥳
Is it meant to show only one month's worth of data in offline mode? If so, my suggestion would be to show at least the present month and the next, since it would be handy in the last week of the present month when registrations for the next month are open too idk 🤷
On the other pages, the url and the tools below are both dynamic, but that's not the case in the mess rates page
It caches all the data you fetch when you're online currently but yeah I'll definitely add some extra routes to cache too. Also you cannot register/(un)cancel when offline
Ah yeah I frogot to fix that
🐸
Registration makes sense imo
Can't do it without web connectivity anyways
Yeah it can't
But if you really wanna see next month's data then just go to that month and then go offline lol
Actually, yeah 😂
oh yeah iOS users I think only Safari lets you install the app to the home screen
Common Apple L
how to install whennandroadi:0
open chrome(ium based browsers) because Firefox has skill issues, and then open the website
There should be a 3 dots button in the address bar. Click it, and click add to home screen
Pick your poison
Same instructions for Firefox,
wasn't that last week for the march past thingie?
She said smth abt her not being available on feb3 and us being allowed to go to sports instead for attendance
But she said she'll confirm this by today through someone she knows
ohkay

how much free labour do they want man
charge them atp 2/2/25, 10:38 PM - Ojas Kataria: What the fuck
Then girish will say shit like "this college doesn't have funds" while he gets paid for this shit which was supposed to be handled by him and not some ug1 kids
Exactly 2/2/25, 10:40 PM - Ojas Kataria: Write code so obscure no one but you can maintain it Job security 📈
job security only matters if you get paid 😞
seriously why do they even take up this work if these mfs can't handle it
Vedant and arnav are doing this for us, they shouldn't have to be doing all this shit just coz of the incompetency of higher ups
aarnav lol
I don't mean vedant and aarnav pai taking up the work
*aarnav
I mean girish taking responsibility in mess issues if hes too unbothered about it cause of his actual work
Yeah ik that i should've worded mine properly
My point being they shouldn't have to do this work
Exactly
but the college is so fucking incompetent
While expecting us to be very competent
What hypocrites
Ah sorry mb
Copying guruji I see are mps built on plagiarism?
goated cv
I'm sorry for having bad internet -_-
Brother compared to the shit vedant has done this shit will prolly look small af

hallo guys the domain for the mess test portal has been changed to https://mess-test.duckdns.org  The old one DOES NOT work anymore.
So if you've installed the old one as an app, you'll have to uninstall it and reinstall it. Sorry for the inconvenience!
hi everyone,  we have coded up a new mess management system under the guidance of prof girish varma, and the members of the student parliament's mess committee. we have been working on this for the past 8-10 days, and wanted to do a small test with the student community to get feedback and improve it before the final rollout. if you want to know the reasons for creating this new portal, why the current system was implemented, and why we cannot directly use the old portal again, please read the mail sent by the student parliament's mess committee in reply to the ~9809883274229394th~ latest mail thread calling out the current mess system.  we have tried to stick as closely as possible to the old mess system. thus, in the new system:  - registrations can be done on a per-meal basis, although all messes have a maximum capacity, allowing only a certain number of registrations. - registrations can be changed, cancelled and uncancelled, upto a certain deadline. - at the moment, the registration and cancellation deadline has been set to 2 days before the meal. this may change as per the institute's mess policies, so do not treat this as final. - registrations can only be done upto a certain time into the future. at the moment, we have set this limit to 2 weeks from the current date. however, this might change as per the institute's mess policies, so do not treat this as final. - monthly registrations have not yet been implemented, since they are unlikely to resume until the rennovation of kadamb completes. we will add this feature once we get the go-ahead from the institute's mess committee. - default registrations are no longer available, since they would cause issues with the caps on registrations. instead, we provide an option in the portal to 'import' registrations from the previous day, from the same day of the previous week, and the entirety of the previous week to make registration easier. - the new mess portal will involve qr codes instead of biometrics/id cards. the mess portal will generate a qr code unique to each user, which you can show to the qr scanner that we will setup in every mess to avail the meal. - this qr system mitigates the privacy concerns that prof girish raised wrt biometrics, and the losing id cards issue slash laziness of students wrt getting id cards to the mess. the portal is a pwa, so you can install it as an app on your phone and it will work offline. even if you don't always carry your phone, the qr is permanent (unless you reset it, see the next point), so you can print it out and carry it with you to the mess (yes this is exactly like an id card, oops). - please note that the qr is tied to you, so you should ideally not share it with someone else - any meals availed with this qr are billed to you. if this does happen, you can reset the qr code during certain periods of time that do not include meal timings and one hour before/after meal timings).  please check out the new portal at mess-test.duckdns.org. note that this is a *test* portal and the registrations, cancellations and uncancellations *will in no way impact your actual meal registrations* on ims. we request you to please give us feedback on the new portal by replying to this message, or dming us. please be kind (we're all ug1s :D), and discuss with us only issues regarding the portal, not the institute's mess policy.  thank you, * vedant kulkarni - me :) * aarnav pai - @917483618341 * neharika rajesh - 70759 70819 she's not in this group lol  ps: * thanks @919611802972 for kick-starting the frontend * thanks to our friends and the random ppl we annoyed in the workspace for preliminary feedback :P

We should add "No bhubaneswar" on the batch hoodie
This ☝ 2/4/25, 12:05 AM - +91 7397 498 522: Guys.. I beg of you all🙏 out of 370 or 390 or whatever, can 40 of you please show up to flash mob practices? You don’t have to do 20 songs. Do 5 or 6. Come with your friends. Have fun. We’re gonna be repeating some of the freshers night/ inter house sem1 wala dances also, so it’ll basically be damn easy for you. I genuinely want to know, why are people shying away? Assignments blah blah is not an excuse. You have to learn how to manage your time. 1hr locked in work a day and within a week you can finish those. When you grow up, and your kids ask you one day what college life is like, what kind of cool stuff college lets you do, what kind of events you took part in, how much fun you had in those etc…, what will you tell them? “Ah sorry buddy I stayed in my room and did assignments and stayed in my comfort zone and didn’t do much.” I get some of you are busy w other felicity stuff like music/drama etc. cool but there is 390 ish of us. Why can’t we come together and do something together. I’m honestly not the kind of person to go around begging people but here I am out of my comfort zone requesting you all multiple times. It is our first felicity. Can we please try to contribute and at least try to make it the best one yet🙏.

we can't do that right now because the main complaint afaik is that the board was useless, and they seem to have fixed it
if you have any more legitimate problems then tell us we'll mail those
the seats are so bad

Pls dm it to me if you have
why does graded lab seem like an exam 😭😭
Ikr I legit thought we had a lab exam
Dsa graded seating arrangements
Yo will there be an extension or not😭😭😭
Yeah but you'll have a grade cut
Yoo can someone elaborate on this
How many marks do u lose in an extension scene
iirc around u lose 20 marks for a given question per extension, first extension is till 9, then then the next extension is the next day and so on
I.e. if you got 100 outside lab but same day, they'll consider 80 marks
Oh
80 percent out of 100 is decent da yay
The next day will by 60%, then next 40% and so on
👍
Total percentage is 16 no so 16/100 * 80 = 12.8/16 is decent ayooo gg
how many graded labs do we have?
6
And best 4 will be considered
Lokesh told me
ohh
how much for each lab?
4%?
Ok yeah this shit is low-key just a lab exam
In Moodle it's given best n-1/n tho???
That's for assignment no
o mb graded lab is n-2/n
For today there will be no 630-730 slot in yoga, please go at 530pm.
Wait so no extension for lab today na?
And what is this assignment extension? And are we losing marks for it?
Supposed to be 10% penalty per day after deadline from next time , for this assignment today 10% and +10 from tomorrow
For assignment?
Yeah
Damn
Does anybody use Fedora or has used fedora? Can't install MySQL :'(
10% of question or complete assignment ?
Been at it for over 2 hours now, even TA is stumped 💀 2/4/25, 10:49 PM - Ojas Kataria: What's the issue?

breakfast will be available in all messes 2/6/25, 12:25 AM - Poonam: why must the messes close 2/6/25, 12:25 AM - Poonam: felicity stalls money farming
for other meals, only yukta will be available, and food deliveries will not be allowed
bro won’t let the underpaid exploited workers have a day off
just felicity tings
The one meal no one eats?
real qatar citizen
wait mess is closed? 2/6/25, 12:26 AM - Poonam: ??????? FOOD DELIVERIES

mess office is the institute's mess committee
Half my mails are from Lokesh Venkatachalam
ppls felishitty stuff is handled by fcs and their committee, parliament does not and will mostly not interfere in these issues
Yes they are
not the parliament one 2/6/25, 12:28 AM - Poonam: there is no way yuktahaar can handle the demand

Lode ka mp
abe nalle
agar felicity ke baare mein mail likhra
toh felicity ko kyu nahi tag kiya
Usse kya pata yaar
But yes, FCs decide these things without Parliament's consultation. 2/6/25, 3:23 PM - ~ Vedant K added ~ Devansh Kantesaria
hello guys!! am here for an hour or two. whats the issue regarding mess closings?
aise nahi hai
its just that final decision is by fcs
Ye student concern raise Krne ka kaam mera nhi h mp's ka hai UG1 mp nalle hai
parliament gensec is here
puch lo ab jo puchna hai
btw, FCs are elected members by the entire college
Puchne keliye kya hi hai ?
Brahad sir 💀
Bhai unhone obviously concern raise kiya hua hai Uske aage unke haath mai nahi hai
💀💀💀
What's the problem in opening 2 messes though Yuktahar mein kitne hi log khate hai
"problem is opening" isn't the question here.
its a method followed since many years
mess staff need a brk also
accha? tujhe bola toh tha ki hamne raise kiya hai the decision is not in our hands
Methods need to adapt
so, its a custom to keep them closed
So yuktahar staff doesn't deserve a break ?
yeah, but why? the reasoning is, its a fest, so stall is one of the main methods of earnings
Not everyone is made of cash though :(
yuktahar is kept open keeping in mind jain people, etc
Stall ka khana Acha hoga toh log apne aap hi jayenge na
I definitely agree in that. that's why yuktahar is open
there will be a waste of food prepared in messes then
Because they registered but they didn’t go 2/6/25, 3:29 PM - Gautam 016: ➕
Increase he cancellations for one particular week that's it
Will that be sufficient? Since all the messes face issues while operating at normal capacities, I fear to imagine how Yuktahaar would be if there is a sudden influx
nows that a valid question to ask
theyve been doing it for years they prolly have an idea of expected footfall
additional seating arrangements have been made in the room opposite yuktahar
Even I am concerned abt this
and we will try to look into it
Ya, and 2 messes can be kept open. I don't think there's any issue.
so crowding should not be an issue
Average batch strength has ben lesser in the past though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
yeah by like 10-15 people
Consider the change in batch size as well
I was thinking about the service times, but ok
they dont hike it up like 100 people in a year na
That small room can't handle the influx from 3 messes
brother not everyone is going yuktahar
this is assuming every single person who normally goes to mess with yuktahar
I think the hike with us was around 60~ people 💀
guys
Footfall will also be increased if we allow eating at mess
thoda sochke baat karo
and they have experienced it already
not all 60 go there bhai, this is our first year, not the colleges, they take decisions w some thought
Sir Abhi bhi yuktahar is just sailing by in terms of capacity If more people come overcrowding can happen
I was just raising my concerns, I have no problem with them shutting 3 messes down
@918807494038
we will try to take care of it. also, of c people will feel slight inconvinece, but its bound to happen in such a big fest
do understand that felicity is the only fest that happens in our college
and, it wont come for another year
so, its a tradeoff between adjusting a little, and enjoying a lot
yeah my point is people just panic monger because they themselves cant imagine what they havent experienced yet lol, the decisions are being made by people with experience, why not trust it
Will the canteens be open @919106660561?
I am well aware of the extra seating  But here is no guarantee that the seating would be enough  The service speed of rotis will also not be able to keep up with additional people
No
nope 2/6/25, 3:35 PM - Poonam: bryh
wefit still open dw
why but?
Tea stall?
Why should someone eat felicity food when they don't want to?
As long as people take the rotis in the hot pack instead of waiting for new ones, I don't see any issues 😂
whats the diff between regular canteens and felicity stalls?
~welcome to iiit?~
paise dono mein dene padenge
_Price_
order snacks and keep bhai, yo pay for canteens anyways
I beg to differ man
vada pavs were like 25 bucks last time
again, see guys, felicity is the ONLYYY FEST!!!! 3 din adjust karne mein itni problem ho jayegi kya?
I get a properly sized dosa at just 10 rs more from canteens
sure theres expensive stuff but tantra also has stuff for like 180
Buzz was more like _only_ expensive stuff :(
I agree
Kai logon ko ho sakti
buzz was much smaller, this is much bigger and therell prolly be more than 3 stalls
buzz mein mess open the
have patience and see man, why is everyone so pessimistic
will there be stalls open in the mornings too? cuz I don't want to eat yuktahar for breakfast 2/6/25, 3:38 PM - Poonam: i don't wanna sound like some health freak but the shit they serve in these stalls are genuinely not meals they're just glorified unhealthy snacks and low quality overpriced fast moving street food 😭
also, this is ur first fest........dekhto lo kya hota hai
phir next year se goa chale jana guys
how do u know which stalls are coming 😭😭
All messes will be open for breakfast though
aakarsh what is the last time you've had breakfast 2/6/25, 3:39 PM - Poonam: seen it in buzz and every event we've had till now tho, it's just rolls/shawarma and noodles and momos and streetfood like that
I don't think there is any stall that serves food with same taste and quality like messes at same price 2/6/25, 3:40 PM - Poonam: and dessert stalls with shakes and icecreams etc.
I think hyderabadi ppl shld capitalise on this and start selling home cooked food  Like genuine goldmine here
i agree 100%. but yaar 3 hi days ke liye adjust karna hai.........yuktahar mein kha lena ek do din
Important question
all messes are open for brkfast
Ya, and even if meals will be there this time, it's evident that they are gonna be unhealthy ones
Sir aap treat dedo na 😂
this is FELICITY. its gonna be diff ~hopefully~
@918487810833  ko bhi nahi di abhi tak. Pehle usko😔 2/6/25, 3:41 PM - Poonam: idts we can do anything Abt the vendor contracts now, let's just hope for the best
before DS midsem
but still
yeah
Contracts can be adjusted to include one more mess I think, just guessing
By the way  Why are ug3 people in ug1 group ? Can't we do whatsapp chats also freely now
We don't hv classes during felicity right?
be optimistic guys. be more energetic. its ur First felicity!!! try to be more excited instead of thinking kaunse stalls aayenge
Huh
No 💀
OMG LSFGOOOOOOO
bhai, we don't know that. don't guess
Even the day after Feli, no classes in the first half
i came for 1 hr to solve ur queries 🥲. will leave after that
So more like a holiday for us
WOW
Why are you here talking abt felicity stall if you don't know heir contract ??
Omg 2/6/25, 3:44 PM - Poonam: 😭 2/6/25, 3:44 PM - Poonam: bro chill
💀💀💀
Can we take a moment to appreciate the NO CLASSES??!??!? FOR 3.5 DAYS
I don't think we asked for such personalised attention but thank you
i mean.....personally, i know......
We have Mids soon after that lmao But yeah
Pawri timeee 2/6/25, 3:45 PM - Poonam: hes trying to help us and clarify doubts why do you have to be stuck up about it 💀
Oh
Oh so you know fcs personally ?
considering meri batch ke hai, ig yeah
That explained why we are getting personalised doubt solving
Wait when did a senior arrive in this gr??
I get the frustration but let's try to be respectful ig  The end goal of this is to come up with some resolution or to find a solution, not to express frustration and anger
nope, its because someone mailed tagging parliament. i felt solving doubts might be better than giving a firm mail reply
see, if u guys don't wont that, i don't mind it at all, i will leave
will just reply to mail only then
Dude Akshat stop tryna be cool
You’re being a jerk
if that's how u want an answer
Lite sir
Let the people who have doubts ask
@919106660561   Is there any scope for any sort of change? Is there a possibility whatsoever or is it completely out of the question? Asking respectfully :)
bhai tere gand me kisne danda dala 💀
hes doing this for our benefit what secret texts are you sending here that god forbid a senior reads
some context. idk i should share this or not, but here we go. what is currently being followed, has been since many years, except last year one additional mess was also open last year. but due to this, many stalls backed out. it was a huge loss,and many shitty stalls came last time. due to this, there were budget issues also.  Hence, a decision was taking by FCs and others involved that its best to keep messes closed, so that we can have a better felicity
abe bc
respectfully baat kar
gensec hai
lite, its okay
time nikalke baat karne aaye hai
maar khaoge tum log aise baat karre toh
That makes sense  I understand the reasoning behind the decision but is there any possible workaround? Otherwise respectfully we would not like to take up much of ur time complaining or ranting if there's no solution possible
currently, i will talk to FCs, but idts kuch change hoga this time. we will try make sure, if people face issues this time, we make sure changes are done nezxt year. i will still ask for changes this time once.
Even trying to ensure that the stalls are priced reasonably would be mighty helpful @919106660561
Thank you so much Genuinely appreciate that Would u be open to taking our points and putting them forward on behalf of us?
unfortunately, I/parliament am not handling all this. FCs are. Even I complained to them ki pls bring good stalls. so, we are in the same boat in this case. but i think better stalls aayenge this time
If so then we can organize our concerns and share instead of unnecessary conflict
Will the felicity ground walls be repaired for felicity😭😭
yeah i will. i think ur MPs already raised this in parliament grp, but I didn't take it up, cause FCs deal with these stuff and I didn't wanna interfere in that. but i will now
Thank you so much :)  Really appreciate it Personally don't have any concerns but I think there were some valid points and issues raised above
.
.
.
also, pls do understand, that FCs/ everyone involved, are students. and they work very hard to make sure the fest is the best one yet. they will be the most happy if they succeed. They have been working hard for like 10 months now......calling sponsors, making deals, bringing artists etc. Please trust them that they don't want bad for anyone
Honestly at least Yuktahaar being open is fine I don't see why we need another veg mess too, as long as capacity is fine. Why is there an argument over this lol
.
thank you guys for handling my torture for an hour!! i will leave now. sorry for coming to ur batch grp
will find out
Exactly
We r very grateful that u took the time to resolve our concerns and hear us out
Kuch log hote hi waise hai😔
Thank u for the effort even though u clearly mentioned it's not ur role
U have no obligation to help us but thank u regardless
He left
@918807494038 you have no tact whatsoever
Exactly
Why would you?
How could you?
Tact aside it was straight up disrespectful
And by speaking in the batch group as opposed to dms, you are sort of ruining our reputation as well
sharing a name with the coordinator of felicity and still being disrespectful is crazy the irony
I mean the only reason this would be an issue is if there was no mess and canteen open at all, but there is
As well as any prospect of change
Nobody's gonna want to help us anymore
Exactly this
Regardless of whether or not there is an issue, there's a way to put things across
Do we want to be known as that batch who are super rude? 2/6/25, 4:04 PM - +91 91066 60561 joined using this group's invite link
Not talking about that at all, talking about why this started in the first place
Wasn't attacking u
:)
sorry to come again, but an update 1. the system wont change unfortunately 2. the prices are affordable
some might be costly also, but others are affordable also. so, its serves all audiance
If it's possible sir could you share the range of variety or types of food that will be provided
wo nahi pata, will ask
Thank you so much
Yay, affordable food at last, lesgoo

Nthg to lose everything to gain ahh situation
Bruh
The mess situation
I meant
Sad
@918807494038 bro tf why u being so rude man
One mess shall be open during Feli (Yuktahaar)
😭😭😭😭😭😭
All messes will serve breakfast
Read everything it's only like 200 messages
Yuktahar breakfast 🔥🔥🔥
Variety of stalls with at least a few offering affordable food
No
Das it afaik
Nais
Nothing more of importance iirc
Nah
I mean we can start raging after we see what's being served during felicity complaining too much now is kinda ehh
Great comeback bro
Guys whats the topic of discussion?
Mess situation during felicity
And what else? I saw some random senior entering + some random guy getting smoked
Random senior 💀
HE IS THE GENSEC OF THE PARLIAMENT
Avg day at obh 2/6/25, 4:32 PM - Gautam 016: Getting smoked or getting a smoke?
The senior was here to answer our concerns
Regarding the mess situation during felicity
Whats the conclusion?
And @918807494038 was being an ass towards him
So mfs flamed him
Wait and see on felicity
If the situation is shit then we can start screaming
I strongly believe grish is behind this
Yess
You will get to know by tonight😂
Isn't the felicity shit mostly done by students tho? Also the reason for the change in mess system is so that the stall owners can make some profit, if they have no scope of profit then they'll refuse to come
same
Even if there are messes students will still come to stalls for food during evening just like they come to canteen
Nah anything that happens i will blame grish
Messes will waste a lot of food then
Brother the stall owners need to make a decent profit
Something similar happened last year
They did came for felicity buzz too ryt??
They kept 2 messes open and the stall owners didn't make that much of a profit as they expected
And we saw how many showed up
So now they want it yo be one
And the variety/prices too
And a bunch of them pulled out too
They were not told beforehand
Yuktahar is still open (but that's the same as no messes being open who in their right mind would eat there yuck)
At least they can keep  the breakfast on
Lunch and dinner in stall is understandable
The breakfast is still there brother
All messes will serve breakfast
In all messes?
Yes
Well then  i am fine
(Anyways i miss breakfast)
Skill issue
We don’t have a yoga class today.
What's the event??
Chess
@VC canteen

from when did siddhartha start allowing phones in class
No idea
Lol
?
he doesnt allow bro he just didnt see
lmao
Point 7 is all that matters 😂
Is DSA also in sh3
We'll ask lini today if she likes sh3
I don't think asking for wifi is really valid considering that you're not supposed to be using it during class hours
There are also no charging ports in sh2 so deal with it
Point 7 + point 9 ftw lmao
But everything else sounds pretty valid
There are? 💀
“my life is bad so you must also suffer”
SH2 is also far from the hostels?
Like a few at the back, not like sh1 where every seat has a charging port 2/7/25, 10:01 AM - Manan: Was there a test for dsa for sec b today
Yes
Yeah that too, it's not that much of a distance from sh1 2/7/25, 10:02 AM - saanvi jain: She taught heaps and took slip test on the same
Ik I come across as being like that but if they do go and make these demands it is very possible that the higher ups will say that "your batchmates in sh2 have the same conditions as well"
Yess bheri tufff exam
bheri bheri bheri tuffffr
tougher than graded labs
So tuff that I came close to killing myself several times, one time I actually succeeded but lini mam dragged my spirit back and told me to complete the fucking exam
Green shirt pls focus on your exam and don't die
I am, in fact, wearing my green shirt rn 2/7/25, 11:28 AM - Pratish 228: The revolving chairs in the workspace are extremely unsafe
huh
why
why?
theyre so comfy 2/7/25, 11:29 AM - Satvik Shrivastava: I agree if you revolve too fast you can get launched 2/7/25, 11:29 AM - Satvik Shrivastava: It needs a seatbelt
Some guy got his phone stuck in the chair and it's broken, last I checked they were still trying to dislodge it
wait wtf thats so sad
Where is B6 309?

What time do Swiggy drivers stop coming inside the main gate
1130 usually
Sure?
not always though
Just say you’re sick or can’t walk
Really???
didnt work for me
why dont they allow past 11 tho
@917497808993 sar xplain?
As per authorities, it's due to security issues
~@mps~😂
However they’re allowed through all hours of the night in faculty quarters
And there’s no provision made to ensure that they only go to faculty quarters and don’t come to student quarters
Didn't work 💀
College will do whatever possibly they can (even build a 5 star hotel) for profs while promtply ensuring that the students get the shitty living condition
Prof living quarters so pretty fr
Because I’ve seen them come till Bakul then take u turn and go to faculty quarters cuz they can’t find them
that too rent free ig
Lowkey
Imma change the location on Swiggy to faculty quarters
And then call and give the guy directions to hostel
yess
good idea
Woah
Smart asf
"I'm lini thomas"
Real shit
No harm trying the faculty way.
We will also try to ask again
guys my friend (yess its my friend, not me  i swear ) needs some pickup lines for his fresher's meet. plz suggest some (not any boring ones)
Try talking to siddartha das
bruh
use a better ringtone 🙄
either don t use phone or use a better ringtone
"Are you a vector, because my destiny seems to be pointing in your direction"     I'm sorry guys, couldn't resist 😭😂
Using kassi rizz like this is a surefire way to get rejected
Are you serious Josh? You think that Siddhartha would get rejected? Siddhartha?
Hia savageness can get any girl
didnt know he could smile
yea
I don't think that siddhartha would get rejected, I think you would
My brain will never register this as someone other than srinivas

hi :)  - we've hosted it on mess-test.iiit.ac.in now, staging server before we deploy to mess.iiit.ac.in soon :) - it is feature complete (except for the menus, they're still a bit weird and yuktahar menu isn't there) - monthly registrations have been added, and a couple of bugs were fixed - we imported all the users from the previous server and gave everyone random allocations - we set the registration window to 4 days and cancellation to 1 day, to show you how it works - please try it out now and send feedback to /dev/null ;P 
Tho I couldn't help but notice the lack of yuktahar menu... is this a ploy to hide info that would potentially make them hesitant towards going to that mess? (Just a joke love u guruji)
pai tooo

POLL: do you want an extension for LA assignment? OPTION: yes (141 votes) OPTION: no (1 vote) 
:>
i rlly want it but very improbable cuz siddhartha
Wait did u finish?
Nope
@919356351244 why
The TAs told me that if many people ask we can get it
So better to try
ohh then nice
pls pin @917093200799 2/9/25, 2:43 PM - ~ Swati Y pinned a message
so more ppl see
yup done
Frisbee team has matches until today evening  So we talked to TAs and they were like oh lite just mail Siddhartha Since you have a *valid* reason he'll extend
He replied in 3 mins saying extended till tomorrow
Unrelated but is there any possible chance of me joining the team (not like I want an extension haha)
How about ctf and research fest?
Poochlo
Mai to aise hi no bol diya
Exactly there were multiple reasons that’s why if we have enough response I’ll send this response to the TAs along with the reason and ask for an extension
also the graded lab
yeaahaahahahh
which gave us trauma
what do you want regarding that?
normalisation?
Fridays was bad kya?
yes but i was quoting that as a reason for la asmt extension
ya
ohh kk
Kitna tha lagbhag avg
aren't u in sec b
I swapped cause of intercollege
it wasn’t that bad  but in comparison to Tuesday’s yes Tuesday’s was way easier
I see
only 60 ppl got 200+
21 300+
it was approx. the same in our lab asw
ohh is it
but there were so many 100s here
so avg is low
so many 100s and 0s
Wait
So is LA extended or not
not yet
rey 💀 mail him na then
Yes plz I can have another nap then...
ya :D
did we get an extension or not?
Seeing that there has been no moodle post regarding the same, I'd suppose not
not yet  after the poll reaches a little over 100 I’ll send it to TAs with the reasons
Girl why did you vote no
😔
The poll asked whether "I" needed an extension Mere technicalities, dw
Lone wolf behavior
Wtf star, this is nothing of that sort
get your friends to vote guys we need it to cross hundred
If its my vote that shall make the difference, I'll cast it differently
Brother just vote yes
Yes it will
Sankalp waiting for the 99th vote just to be the 100th
Seriously? Is your case that weak 💀
No but when we're talking numbers even 1 vote counts :)
Done btw
Lesgo
We finna getting extension
Siddhartha certainly won't consider 1 or 2 measly naysayers against the whole batch though
_or will he?_
bro just do it
Come on now, I have voted "Yes", what more do you want of me?
Yeah but when the front bench professor rizzler asks him surely it'd make a sizable difference in his judgment making
The same student he's told to shut up twice in class, yeah, surely 😂
I mean giving an extension is a surefire way to get you to shut up
someone just ping me once it crosses hundred thank you
yup saw it
sending it now
Yuh
Kartikeya smthg?
why did u save me like that 😭
Yeah lmao i told you also
✨lore✨
Lmao that's fucking hilarious
hmmm ya
Ik what im saving your name as now
All my contact names are either lore or just their full names lmao
I'm not changing what I've saved his name as
Hmmm im curious now whats mine
Lmao wot is it
neharika what is mine
(For legal reasons I will not reveal) 🤫🧏
credits for the long message to thapa btw lmao
i have yours saved as iiit mp madam 🙏
L
Except mine I don't see any lore or my full name
Is my full name that hard to spell
Kartik Thapa
Haaris
Lovely lmao
real shit 🔥
how likely is it that siddhartha gives us an extension 😭
I've only saved 3 people with different names
I mean TAs said we will get it  so trust them ig ;-;
id say 70%
Just a concern... the G8+G10 LA TAs always explicitly mention in tuts that the only medium of communication regarding assignments should be via moodle; will the TAs respond to the WhatsApp group message for extension?
someone write an extension mail
we all will +1 on it
mp mil jani chahiye extension
nahi mili toh ggwp
Don't spam
Never spam with Sidhartha Das
are +1 as in emoji reaction 2/9/25, 4:35 PM - Krrish Gupta: real
we will ask the tas first, and if they recommend it, we will mail the prof
Someone with good english write it Pls do not chat gpt it. Mention all the valid reasons
agar tum log ko alag se kuch krna hai kr lo but we will not take the responsibility of ensuring it goes ok
do it asap then
yeah yeah nws in you we trust just do it
don't be so impatient we don't have any agenda ki extension nhi dilwaenge
we're doing what we have to do
are mai bas keh rha yaar aur kuch nahi 😔😔😔
acchi baat

@919435383781 wEb sEcUrItY
U cant do anything useful with this
When the server was on, all his files were open to download 💀
Including IIIT Stuff
Oh yes
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
~I can DDoS him~
Zero trust ❌ Trust everyone ✅
I'm not even paying attention I can't see half the shit he's showing anyways
If it was grish i would have done that
real shit man this nigga be blabbering to himself atp hes just revising
Fr fr
Lmao
Sounds funnnnn Imma join you
Are there any slides for this shit?
exactly
Should've downloaded those off his laptop when his server was on
🤣🤣🤣
I'd have to pay attention to do that
And if I paid attention I wouldn't need the slides in the first place
He is not just putting the hardrive information he has put up all the files inside them too 😂
Ya obviously, its a recursive listing
Yes ( ~99%~ ) he will upload them.
I have no idea what any of these words mean
You don't need to Just chill
Essentially meaning he's teaching bad
atleast its iot rather than social science
I mean it could also mean me generally not giving a shit to what goes on in iot
Agreed, I'd rather have this the Social Science.
Wait, is dude contemplating his life choices?, What is he doing?
He must be creating pass.h 😅

Hi everyone,  The DSA Midsem Lab exams are being held on 1st and 2nd of March (not sure which groups are on what day). Since most ppl have 2 exams on the 1st, and 2nd is a Sunday, if a majority of the batch wishes for the exams to be shifted, we will raise this with the TAs and profs. If a majority votes yes, we will talk to the TAs and profs and put another poll for what dates it should be shifted to.  Please vote accordingly :)
This might prepone or postpone the exam, no guarantees. It will happen during (+-1 day) the midsems.
Prepone ka baat sunthe hi yes to no kardiya
they said poll for date also ryt
Ooh  I did not see that 😅
is it valid to request that we get to know the testcases in teh practice problems?

Focus on the tut lil bro

Whoever missed the DSA slip test on Friday(7th February), due to the BITS tournament, please dm me with roll number
There was one?
Yeah
Or actually lite we have the list. Don't need to dm. Thanks
I have a question
Lini said they dont
Just submit it before the due
whats the weightage for slip tests in DSA?
4%
No classical rules? 1. Move your pawn to the enemy king 2. Kill it 3. Win Gg ez give me my prize money
Aw hell naw who quantized my classical chess
Event details encrypted in the poster
Sanyam
Rules will be explained in the event
It’s total or every slip test ??
wait is it today?
damn
Yes
Has to be total
If the event details remain in a superposition of hidden states, collapse the uncertainty and join us at 8:30 PM today at H2O4.
Instructions unclear, ended up in another dimension is this normal?
if its a part of the basis set of your Hilbert space, sure it should be normal and orthogonal to the other dimensions
Idk what that means I think I got isekaid
Also, the event is just after the LA paper showing, so come directly to H204 to lighten your mood after learning about your LA marks
Genuine Request for Change in PEC administration.  I’m assigned a 6:45-7:45 TTS slot for my sports, which i’ve been following since the start of the semester. Today, since I have 2 paper showings and a doctors appointment scheduled, I went at the 5:30 slot instead despite being sick, did the whole warmup, and when I went to put attendance, Nagaraju started bitching at me and told me I won’t get attendance because I “didn’t ask permission to do sports outside my slot”. I genuinely want to know what the fuck the difference is between a person exercising at 5:30 pm, and 6:45. If I was an MWF slot, I wouldn’t even have argued. There wasn’t a crowd to manage either, as only 15-20 other people were there besides me. And despite explaining the circumstances to him, he just told me he won’t give me attendance and to come back at 6:45 and do it, not even trying to listen to what I was saying and just showing attitude the whole time. If the point of a sports department is to ensure that students stay physically active and engaged, what the fuck are they gaining from actively deterring students from participating in sports when they can? What genuine fucking issue would it have been if they took the 10 extra seconds to flip the page and check my name. I’m not usually one to send a paragraph like this, but I know i’m not the only one who’s dealt with this shit and I genuinely want to request a collaborative mail to raise our voice about this shit. Even if it goes no where, I just want to tell Nagaraju he’s a sad piece of shit loser going through a midlife crisis.
Dont underestimate ur opponents
i forgot and couldnt find it in mail ;_; too busy running around for parliament work
Why are mps standing the front like security or sumtin
Cause we have to leave 😭😭😭😭
Cso bhi hai
I mean just leave then 👍
We have to see our paper you know -_-
Today’s cso showing is just for A right
Ye
Does vedant have to tho?
He's prolly getting full anyways
Same shit happened with me da, though I was trynna put attendance in TTS cause I missed sports yesterday due to assignment+ctf+marathon+presentation exhaustion 😔
yeah i saw them talk to you 😭
what the fuck is going on w them man
Dunno man, maybe it's just the best part of day for him,
Some people are just sadist
I know I've already mentioned this, but in 1st sem I had morning sports and since it was raining we had to just show up and give biometric. I showed in sandals coz u know, it's fucking raining and we're not doing sports anyways. These mfs refused to give me attendance since I wasn't wearing shoes. Wtaf is wrong with these people. Only reason I got attendance was coz some kind soul lent me his shoes. Fuck these egotistical idiots.
does anyone in sh1 have a stapler
update: went rn and got attendance, still stand by my opinion that it’s a retarded system and can be heavily improved
🙏🙏
post in spam @iiit, someone in ws might
i think the guards have one
What happened guys ?

Me after LA results: I wanna be your first target
did we find out the average?
8+ig
what kind of a joke is this?
bruh for the number of kassi s we have
[Borrow] Vedant guruji on feb 14 👉👈
it is expectede
for the kind of bs correction
Haha lmao
bold of you to assume he doesn't have 6 girls already asking him
come to duels at desk on the same day to get a chocolate and propose
I heard somewhere 6-6.5, no it should be around 7 now
Duels at dusk*
exactly u get to flex too
Average of LA
I'll fight to the death for vedant
Wallahi
What is this
that osdg reviews website should include TAs also tbh.  TAs have very little accountability then other than if people raise the issue to prof. Not showing up for paper showings is annoying af and deserves insta -1 star
Istg I'm already depressed about my insanely low score and I can't even get marks for one of the questions I did correct
there is this one guy whos tryna prove I wrote something extra now just coz he forgot to see something
What the fuck
Why are the tas like this man
Oi you alr have someone no did you forget abt him :<
yeah apparently there is distinction between different shades of dark blue
Dw abt it 👍
that was the head TA I think 🥲
Got rejected again 😔
tf am i screwed or smtg?
nah lite he prolly doesn’t even remember shit
too many people
Holy fucking shit as if this paper wasn't ass enough already (I did pretty shit let me cope)
idk he wrote some ugly ass remarks
damn
are AI models good enough to correct 🤔. probably considering most of the stuff we have are relatively common stuff. time to replace TAs(*at least for correction) fr 😂
Why is the average so high anyways
And why haven't they officially released any average
it's gonna be smtg around 6-7.5
Brooo, half of the TA's don't know math and can be fooled fr marks by writing large complex words that don't make sense but are related to the question.  Won't work against AI.
Well fuck
exaclty and sometimes if the ta's know u or smtg, u just get easy marks
they cut my marks for using rank lol none of my answers were incorrect this sounds weird on the basis of my last sem's performance but it is what it is
Let's make one ~from ground up~
Our ta didn't even give a shit abt what we wrote for the 1st question and outright gave us 0.5, and didn't even show up
considering most of the stuff we have our quite standard it should work pretty well tbh. and train a reasoning model well enough nd then it should be able to go at least verify steps pretty well
coming up with a novel proof is a different story
if we train a model specifically for that then it would definitely work
dude lit that guy took my marks out coz I didnt show the steps to solve a linear eqn in 2 variables
I can't tell if this guy is being serious or not
but a general one won't
I think r1/o3 should work p well too
I am lmao
yeah but we have limited access to those
Just pay
Better than paying each TA 6k per month
Or run of local machine
money doesn't grow on trees not all of us are well-off
Then use MS AI toolkit
Where do even get a linear eq in 2 variables 😭 (I'm failing for a reason)
yep kinda but it's gonna be high-effort in the beginning
By the way, I hope you guys realise that you all will be TAs in 3rd year
Perplexity also has offered free perplexity pro(that includes deepseek R1 and o3 mini)  for multiple indian colleges.  Unfortunately they have excluded IIIT H for some reason
No
"you all"?
Many of us*
I think the dean needs to apply
Nah like 2 eqns 2 variable shit
Yes only you sanyam
and you'll get it
Brother hell naw ain't no way I'm doing this shit
nah
have they? good for those clgs then
That's a nice way of saying that you want to become a ta
Let's meet him and get it done then
Damn even the coding topper said "nah" to the tas bs
Hey, you are gonna be CPro and DSA TA
For sure
He is better than them.  Values his time
Being a TA is tooo much time lost and headache fr 6k
Hey, just because he can become a ta doesn't mean he wants to become a ta
Only arts/VE TA is good. Free money without any work
Okay green tshirt
that pays you 1/2k per month
No, it's the same for all courses, including SAVE
really?
That's what I was conveyed by gensec
ah must've changed now
we utilise our resources efficiently and faithfully
definitely because we're paid well
Bto where did u get that cpu cabinet?
DSA lab
we stole it
obviously
YouTube is closed source, you shouldn't be using it 😞
Rip to that guy who will come to dsa lab just to see his cabinet missing
Damn didn't know narendra modi had dsa

Hello everyone,  Rishabh Khawad, a IIIT-H Alumnus is here on campus and is interested in having a casual discussion with the students today 4:45pm at jc/amphi. Rishabh is former Alumni Cell coordinator and he also founded a pretty good startup and sold it later on. I urge you all to come and have a quick chat with him. Also react to this message if you are coming just to get an idea.   You can also check out his LinkedIn profile- https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishabh-khawad?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=android_app
Hi guys ! Do show up at 4:45 at JC, and we can all have fun conversations with him. He can get to know you guys, you can get to know him. He has gone through a lot while managing his current startup and competing against other big funded giants like zupee and dream11 etc. etc. and staying in the ocean, having conversations with VCs, properly handling startup's runway money, and a lot of different life lessons as well. maybe for example, how to swim through your research or placements or college life. He did go for a research intern to Spain as well. He was under Madhav sir in RRC.  So yeah. if you're available, do show up to gain new connection and have some random fun conversations for a few minutes.
Who is him
@916354109703

How this is linked to language
Dear all,  We are happy to announce that we are going to be testing the new mess system in Yuktahar Mess tomorrow (Thursday, 13th February) for lunch and dinner. We request all students (especially those registered for Yuktahar this week) to carefully read this email, as this new system will be a significant departure from the current system on IMS.  1. The new mess portal has been deployed for testing at https://mess.iiit.ac.in. It requires VPN/IIIT WiFi/LAN to load, but once it has been loaded, it works offline with limited features - you can view existing registrations and your QR code (see point 3), but not create/update registrations. 2. Only students who have registered for (and not cancelled) lunch and dinner in Yuktahar on Thursday, 13th Feb, will be able to log in to the new portal with their CAS/LDAP credentials. If you are not able to login, please send us an e-mail immediately. 3. We will no longer be using biometric or ID cards for verifying that you have registered for the meal. Instead, the new mess portal will generate a unique QR code for each user, which they can show to the scanner at the mess desk to avail the meal. In case there are any problems with the QR system, the biometric and paper list of registered students will still be there as a backup.  For instructions on how to login to, and use the new mess portal, please refer to the attached document. If you face any issues or have any feedback regarding the new mess system, please do reply (not reply-all) to this email.  Thank you, Regards, Students' Parliament Mess Committee
DAMNNN IT'S FINALLY HERE
🛐
We had to cancel
Yeah I kinda thought it'd be more like a squid game challenge type shi
Wait what
Wtf
no im the mail it said it will be automatically cancelled?m

Thank you so much @917745090290 and @917483618341 for making the new mess system ❤️

Hey everyone, We are happy to announce that food stalls will be available on campus during Felicity! Below is the list of food stalls along with the cuisines they will be serving: * Dominos - Pizzas, Garlic Bread, Choco Lava * Urban Wok - Chinese * Friger Co - Burger, Fried Chicken * Friger Co - Fries, Spiral * Bagara Miya - Biryani, Bagara Rice * Paris Patisserie - Desserts * Wah Punjab - North Indian * MOM - Shakes * Waffcha - Waffles, Water * Mohammedia - Shawarma and Momos * Chaa Time - Boba Tea * Rahul Tiffins - Tiffins * Roll Call - Frankie and Mughlai Paratha * Chaat House - Chaat * Yummy Bites - Popcorn, Cotton Candy, Sandwich * Polar Bear - Ice Cream *Coupon System* This year, we are implementing a coupon system for food purchases to streamline the process and ensure everyone has a better overall experience. Students will receive coupons in denominations of ₹100, ₹200, and ₹500. All students must purchase coupons from the designated sale points near the food stall area. Food stall vendors will have smaller denomination coupons (₹10, ₹20, ₹50) to provide change.  For Example: If a student buys food worth ₹80, they can pay with a ₹100 coupon and receive a ₹20 coupon as change from the vendor. This ensures that money is not wasted.  Terms and Conditions for Payment: No cash or UPI payments will be accepted at the stalls. All students must purchase coupons from the designated sale points near the food stall area. ₹500, ₹200, and ₹100 coupons will be stamped. Ensure your coupon is stamped before purchasing, as unstamped coupons will not be accepted. Once purchased, coupons cannot be returned and must be used during the fest. Coupon sales start on the 13th evening near the mess. If any food stall is found accepting cash or UPI payments (with proof), the student reporting it will be rewarded by SR Foods.  Tips to Avoid Long Queues: We recommend purchasing sufficient coupons for all three days to avoid long queues. Buy higher denomination coupons as sufficient change will be available at all food stalls.  The coupon distribution will begin at 7:40 pm today outside Yuktahar. We understand that this may be a shift from the usual way of purchasing food, but this system is designed to streamline transactions, reduce delays, and ensure a hassle-free experience for everyone. By using coupons, we can avoid long wait times at stalls and ensure that vendors can serve food efficiently without dealing with cash or digital payments. We appreciate your cooperation in making this process smooth and enjoyable for all!  Enjoy the fest and the delicious food! Cheers,
MOHAMMEDIA SHAWARMA?????
What's the reward ?
Idk, this came on Outlook 😂
I bet it's more coupons
Lol yeah
Water
Idk if I'm being retarded but I  think I'd rather prefer digital cash over standing in an entire ass extra fucking line just to get coupons
"Choco" + lava 💦
I am slightly perturbed by the fact that none of the prices have been mentioned 💀
this system is shit
There is no converting back either
Ikr the "justification" they gave for using coupons sounds stupid af
So if you by mistake overpurchase, you're fecked
Digital cash makes shit easier ffs
It reduces handling of physical cash, in this case replaced by coupons
I was telling the same from the start 😞
Who even came up with this system
why is 100 the smallest denomination
It all feels like they have some ulterior motives and just trying to fuck us over with this shitty system
Coz they want to sell you overpriced shit
sanyam what are you laughing at
why couldnt they just implement some kind of digital wallet
this is an it college
And the fact that the smaller denominations are available to only the vendors
Its most prolyl like this For every bit of overpurchased money, the vendor gains some pocket money
I'll ask them to do so next year
And the FC were like "Yep, that works just fine with us"
I need team plz dm
Single player also available
Better to team up though

How many times is this gonna be forwarded here
haa bhai samajh gaye chutiya system hai aur spam karne se kuchh nahi hoga
Only part I understood is chutiya system and I agree
Really 😂 ?
Wait guys, Vedant was kidding. There are things cheaper than 100
Yeah, you can purchase a grain of rice for only 99₹ 🤑
Then why aren't they giving smaller denomination
Lol I thought 100rs ka vada pav khana padega
Waattttttttt
Coz get want us to spend more
The vendors have smaller denominations apparently
yea
according to mail
Which we can get only by buying larger denominations... yeah
i love scams 🥰
When does the coupon distribution end?
atleast there 100rs as a set price hopefully that will be a little better
if it was just 200/500 would have been insane
got to pay for that Bollywood band no one cares about 😔
It doesn't
It'll be there the whole 3 days
Yeah that's where the scam bit comes in
Also they think literally every single mess + canteen is closes btw nobody tell em otherwise
are they not???
Isn't that the case anyways? That only Yuktahaar is open?
Or will the canteens be open 👉👈
Ahh just a doubt, what if we are left with some coupon ( money) will that be again translated back to our real money?
no
Hahaha no
according to mail no
Tf
No like. Tf
Damn
Cant wait for the mail which opposes this
Why we not doing regular upi thing? Like what's wrong with that, FCs afraid they won't get the cut out of the profit or wot?
write it yourself 😂
Confirmed with the ppl there, no
They think even yukta is closed i think 2/13/25, 8:30 PM - Poonam: can someone confirm if the coupons are counterfeitable 😔
No comments 🤐
They look incredibly counterfeitable
Even the stamps on the back
this is normal carnival system
Yeah, which is shit
And even then they give you smaller denominations
no more autos to obh or parijat 😣

please note that mps do _not_ have a final say in this; we were only conveying what the fcs told us
Yeah, affordable as in you can buy shit, don't look at the miniscule quantity they give you
And the coupons make shit so much worse
we will only look into it when there are 0 objections from section b ppl so far i see 12 no votes and 0 yes votes from section b
Yes I get that. The college is the one that's retarded
It's ungraded anyways lite only
There are many yes votes from section b
Sirji ik no to apka hi hai😭
haa toh mujhe lab prepone nahi karni na 😂 lekin agar baaki sab section b vaalo ne ok bol diya toh mein baat karlunga tas se swap ka
I'm not ok either, dw 👍
Arey its ungraded man show sec a peeps some compassion na
The thing is  Apki to ungraded hai, so prepone bhi hogyi to you have one full week But humari graded hai 🥲
See it's a win win only  Midsem starts from 25 Section b has graded on 24th And ungraded on 21st So you can  prepare for midsem
Guys come over to kadamb road in front of old parijat gate

i am asking lokesh sir then
i also want this to happen😭
okk puchle
Umm what's the beef abt
Sec a guys have graded lab this Tuesday, sec b has ungraded lab on Friday, they want to switch so that they have more time to prepare and can focus on enjoying felicity
Uh is the monster energy thing still there?
I think so
But they open the bottle and give it to you 😑
do not consider my vote   i was held at gunpoint while voting
what vote are we talking about what
see pinned
ohhhh
Dude wtf sec a guys
??? What even
I mean there a sec b guys who also sympathize with u, don't pull off this shitty behavior
Hello guys  Come to duels at dusk You’ll get free chocolates if ya win !!!!! ✨✨🌟🌟🍫🍫
It's just one guy, most of us are just trying not to get screwed over in the lab
In front of Old Parijat
But still, sec a guys don't screw over the rest of ur sec coz of ur nonsense
let me clarify my stand on this i do not mind lab swaps only if *no objections from section b ppl exist*, and i *will not tolerate* anyone forcing their friends to vote in a way they don't want to. i will go out of my way to block the swap if there are section b students who object to it and section a people are trying to steamroll them. also my earlier message had a typo I meant to type 18 not 17 😭
Need a black shirt (preferably small or medium) and a mundu urgently  Please....

hey so i assumed if you dont register for yuktahar during the fest your registration at whatever other mess gets automatically cancelled
why the fuck am i still being billed for south food during felicity?
what they dont? 💀
welcome to iiit.
do _not_
time to write angry mail
to whom should it be addressed
let me rephrase
Mess commmittee :D
Pls write
Be very angy
which retarded and incompetent body should i raise a genuine issue with so that they can continue to be as fucking useless as humanly possible
The email that sends the mess registration reminder on outlook
include student list or no
We'll take it up from our end too but pls go bully them a bit
Wtv you prefer :)
Wait what the fuck?
gotcha
It prolly shows on ims but I don't think it'll be included in the bill
I'd like to report a severe lapse in responsibility from this body, once again. I have noticed that I have been billed for South Mess during the Felicity fest despite the mess not serving any food during this time. With the stalls being very overpriced and overglorified, it feels as if this esteemed educational institute doesn't actually care for its students except to leech off money from it.  For how long will mistakes and lapses keep occurring in the mess committee. Time and time again, we students have felt utterly let down by this committee for its multiple failures over the course of our time here. Kindly please address this issue as soon as possible.
Pls mention that stalls are overpriced and the food is practically bland 👍🏼
Started
Hallo anyone need a team for Battle of Brains
i'll mention that i hope this
yea it should
who said
@919175977518 it'll be adjusted in the billing
You can still write your angy mail but it'll be adjusted 👍
Accha okie nvm then

Hey everyone, please make your way to the Felicity ground. There are so many incredible artists here, and this event has been put together with an immense amount of effort. Our seniors, along with many of us, have worked tirelessly to bring these artists to our fest and make it an unforgettable experience for everyone.  It would truly mean a lot if we could show up and support them. Performing for a small crowd, especially after they’ve taken time out of their busy schedules to be here, is disheartening and unfair to them. Let’s give them the audience they deserve and make this fest as amazing as it was meant to be! See you all there! 2/15/25, 8:34 PM - Kartik: Guys start showing up to FG, MM Keerawani 's team is here for a stellar performance 🔥  This is the same team that performed in Amphi a while back for their music video
DJ is starting in like 10 mins ppl.. Comee to FG!!!🔥

Every day I become more and more convinced they dont actually give a fuck about our physical fitness they are just sadist bastards who should be curb stomped
What happened?
I wore cargo pants to sports 😭😭😭😭
What happened
.
If this guy fucks me over when I go in the next slot, hands will be thrown
Anyone has a thought of sending a mail thread or something so that these sadists allow some flexibility in sports.  In both which batch you come for and to allow you the freedom to the sports when you want and with the excessive obsession with dresss code and timings. Tooo particular about dresses he is.
Rushil said he'd do smth when he got fucked over but idk what happened
Ill draft a mail if he fucks me over today

Hi,  Since there are CSO tutorials:  - from 2 to 3 for groups 1, 2, 3 on Friday, and - from 2 to 3 for groups 7, 8 on Tuesday  These tutorials conflict with the swapped lab, and unless the CSO TAs are willing to swap the slots as well, the DSA labs will go back to their original schedule:  - graded lab for section A will happen tomorrow - ungraded lab for section B will happen on Friday  The final schedule could be told to us latest by tomorrow morning.
Graded for B will not change right?
Ayo what
How confirmed is this?
no
We will swap this time, announcement would come in some time
Im confused what's gonna happen now?
wait when is section B's graded lab?
on binary search trees
Section B will have ungraded DSA Lab tomorrow
Next Monday
2-5 only?
Ye
24th
Woohoo
The CSO TAs have agreed to swap tutorials, the DSA labs will be swapped as well.
Section A will have their graded lab on Friday, and Section B will have their ungraded lab tomorrow. Please wait for an official announcement from the CSO TAs for the new tutorial timings.

Hello people While solving DSA asmt/lab problems, say your solution passes all given testcases but WAs for some hidden testcases, try "Stress testing" your code. While stress testing, you first write a slower solution which you are sure is correct. There usually are other subtasks with easier constraints for which you can submit this and check. Even if it isn't there, I hope it should be easy to code up some very slow brute force solution. Then you write a random input generator and pass this input to both the brute force and your fast but wrong solution. You let this run till it finds a testcase where it fails. Either watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXTVOyQpSGM Or this read this article to learn how to do this: https://ali-ibrahim137.github.io/competitive/programming/2020/08/23/Stress-Testing.html 2/18/25, 10:58 AM - ~ Vedant K pinned a message
For ungraded labs do we need to follow the seating pattern?
the old one or the randomly allocated one?
The randomly allocated one
Im assuming 2/18/25, 1:45 PM - Poonam: Is that permanent
no no
the old one where we sat and wrote the system number on the paper and all
Aah okie
So the random is just for graded ones?
Phones wagere leke jaa sakte hai?
Sure?
yea i think so confirm with tas ;_;
Are Cso tuts mandatory?
I think the first tut is
do we have to leave our phones and bags outside
yes
this is how secA was during last ungraded lab
Does attendance matter for ungraded?
no
Lmfao what the heck
Never seen that before uh
It's cute
Wtf
Like you, ak💩h

Can I play vedant guruji in the movie pls
Only guruji is worthy of playing guruji
Us peasants cannot even come close to mimicking his unmatched grandeur
Why would guruji participate or partake in stupid activities like acting in a movie?
He is too busy being a king
True
Should we just buy a custom bodysuit that looks just like guruji and have someone wear it and play him
I wanna wear it
Who wouldn't wanna wear it
I called divs
Nah it's all mine
In fact, lets just make half of everyone wear guruji bodysuits and the other half aarnav bodysuits
Except for one person who can be the cooked frog
Worth making one
vpn works again lfggg
Ykw u peasants fight for guruji
I'll play aarnav sar
my condolences

A friend of mine shared this with me. It's a hackathon where you need to develop a website. Team of 2-4 members, registration fee ₹50, prize pool of ₹10k distributed among top 3. If interested, please check this link out.  https://unstop.com/o/s1YT3vG?lb=bDUgV1dm&utm_medium=Share&utm_source=shortUrl
Is there anyone who has registered in kadamb mess and is not availing it today(lunch)?
What if the given website itself is the scam and just robs us of 50rs (I haven't opened the site so I'm just assuming it's to create a scam site)
Well, click the link to find out then :)
Nice try diddy
Website is jainwin ✅👍
Lol Although I don't get why you need to create a scam website
how else will you rob people of their life savings?
hey can i use the same qrs twice?? or is it rate limiting?
Limited
Only one
Once*
nope
Per meal
no you can only use it once

What if they stumble upon a very genius scam idea? Raise awareness or....
Dk, maybe this website is also a part of bigger scam (₹50*nstudents)
So far n=4 so

lmao 2/20/25, 5:55 PM - Ojas Kataria: Spoiler alert
Dear all,  We are happy to announce that we will be beginning registrations today on the new mess portal (mess.iiit.ac.in) for the first two weeks of March. Please read this mail carefully, since the new system is a significant departure from the current weekly registration system on IMS.  *Registrations and Cancellations*  1. The new portal brings back the per-meal registration system, and allows registrations at different messes for each meal. 2. Registrations can be made upto 4 days in advance, and cancellations upto 2 days in advance. 3. Registrations will be capped at a fixed number per mess, as defined by the Mess Office and Institute Mess Committee. 4. Since the registrations will only be opening for the first two weeks of March, monthly registrations will not be permitted. 5. The number of allowed cancellations is 5 per meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner).   *Availing Meals via QR Code*  1. All messes will use the QR code scanners exclusively from the first of March. The biometric machines will not be used any more. 2. The mess portal will generate a QR code unique to every student, which you can use to avail meals at your registered mess. You can access the QR code by clicking on the button in the top right corner on the new mess portal. 3. Please download your QR code onto your phone, or take a printout of it before coming for a meal since network connectivity is poor in the messes. If for some reason you cannot use your QR code, please carry your ID card instead. 4. If you wish to access the portal offline, you can download it as an app by clicking on the 'Add to Home Screen' or 'Install as App' button in your browser on your phone. Note that this is an experimental feature, and we recommend that you also keep the QR code downloaded onto your phone.  Please login to https://mess.iiit.ac.in (via CAS for IIIT students, and via email and password for MSIT students and interns) and register for your meals. Note that the site requires IIIT VPN/WiFi/LAN to work. If you are facing problems with the website, please clear your browser's cookies and cache and reload the website. If you face any difficulties in logging in or using the new portal, or have any feedback about the new system, please do send an email to messportal.admins@students.iiit.ac.in.  We would like to specially thank Aarnav Pai and Vedant Kulkarni (UG2k24) for developing and maintaining the new mess system, as well as the Institute Mess Committee, Mess Office, IT Office, and staff at all messes for their support, guidance and feedback, without which this endeavor would not be possible.  Thank you, Regards, Students' Parliament Mess Committee

i mean LA and DSA aren’t on monday anyways, but other classes profs will confirm we’ll ask tmr
Monday is Tuesday's timetable though
Lini told me that she will take a class on Monday
oh bruh
siddhartha was saying he has 2 classes left so i’m assuming he’s taking too
Damn i have only 2 more potions left of sidd  😞
Lini mam also said that she will take one class post midsems
i felt bad for siddie boi man
How 2?

He might take 1 after midsem

please do not miss these classes
lini ma'am has said she'll complete avl trees on monday, and that will be part of the midsem syllabus
please bol diya ab to jaana hi padhega
Wtf is FN and AN?
forenoon, afternoon
FN is before 1pm  AN is after 1pm
basically monday morning classes will be held tomorrow afternoon
After 2 PM*
Uh midsem as in theory only right?
Forenoon is a real word uh
Wild
The fact that afternoon is after2 😭
Iiit standards
anybody who’s understood the testcase grading thing, could you explain?
i think its x amount of marks for y testcases you pass
still dont follow
so lets say theres 10 testcases if you pass 2 you might get 0 you pass 4 you might get 40/100 so on so forth
It will no longer stop once it meets an error
ahhhhh thats good
okay but have they given those numbers?
and how does that factor in w the batchwise division in oj
will depend qsn to qsn and that will be highlighted
are they saying theyll do their own batchwise thingy?
Mam said otherwise in class though :(
only 1 batch ryt?
nvm it does go on even after failing a case
in the mail which they sent there were 2 batches which stopped after WA

India vs Pakistan - the age old rivalry dwelling into the colors of the Champions Trophy, where the top 8 battle in a short but exciting format. Our home team has been on a redemption arc after a rough few couple of weeks. But with the top order seemingly back in form and the confidence boost after consecutive wins, we meet the hosts (on paper) who will be looking for a comeback after facing a loss in their tournament opener. But whatever the conditions, the temperatures are going to soar and the tensions will rise when these 2 cricketing giants lock horns on 23 Feb starting from 2:30pm. Join us in SH1 for a day of excitement and thrill and to support our national team in their search for yet another ICC trophy.

Hi everyone,  The DSA TAs have informed us that:  1. The lab exams will be held during normal lab slots (so Section A will have it on Tue, 4th March, and Section B will have it on Fri, 7th March). 2. The lab exams will be held in place of the practice labs, so those labs will essentially be cancelled. The questions for the practice lab will be sent on 3rd March instead, and doubts/questions can be asked in tutorials/TA hours. 3. The week after the lab exams, we will have graded labs as per the schedule again (March 11 and 15).  If there are any problems with this, please message us or put a message on the batch group as soon as possible.  Thank you :) 2/22/25, 4:49 PM - ~ Vedant K pinned a message

Bro runs the opensourced LLM in his brain during lab. that explains everything
Nah bro so goated that he helps the ai instead the rest of us plebians who ask ai for help

Making our ancestors proud

Hi,  Around 250 more ug1s are left to register for meals on the 1st of March!  The registration is due *tomorrow* midnight! Please register for your meals on https://mess.iiit.ac.in quickly, it only takes a minute!  If you're not registered by the due date, you'll be allotted a mess by random! 
Just keep on asking doubts  inthat way he wont proceed further
Don't tell me someone stole the banner
Found it
Nah, we haven't reached that level of civilization yet. ~OBH might have ig~
Wait what
So if we like take a dual degree course
If we leave the course before 5 years
Do we still get the 4 years honors
Guys a junior is asking me a doubt
And idk how it EXACTLY works
Someone pls help
Brother is asking the real shit
Nope
Oh you dont
Crazy
We don't get shit if we don't publish a thesis*   *if we fuck up hard enough and spend 8(?) years without a thesis, we leave with a B.Tech and our transcripts would say "unfit for research" or the like
At least this is what I've heard from seniors
Thankuuuu
Damn that's bad 🥲
And how many people leave this way
You get the ms + btech together so no you can't run away with only one degree
I haven't heard of any case (yet)
You can always ask your advisor to extend
With their approval you can stay longer
Just the maximum allowed time without an extension approved by your advisor is 7 years
Oh like that
Interesting
But even this is capped to 8 academic years (or 9, I heard that this was changed recently)
Peak
Thats my alarm tone now 🔥
Nope that's not possible here
I have mess already registered on 1st March via ims  Should I cancel that and register through new mess system?
@917745090290 @917483618341 you guys probably already have but just make sure that people who've already registered on ims as well, don't get double booked or something
you dont _have_ to cancel on ims, bur please do register thru the new portal
ims registrations for 1st march won't be considered
From?
wdym?
From 1st march onwards na?
ha yes
wait have they not yet stopped ims registrations for march??
Nope
I'm registered until like 22nd March
😭😭
ok thanks
For March, all registrations will be done on the new Portal, including the 1st of March.
IMS registrations will not apply in March.
yo do we have previous years papers for dsa

But anyways everyone pls remember to wear black
Why
We all gonna look like a bunch of fools if only half of us show up in black
Lini/siddhartha prank, since they refer to us by the colour of our tshirt
You know half of the batch isn't even on the grp right
Like you're gonns have half yhr ppl show up in not vlack anyways
Which is why official announcements exist (hint hint)
Post in announcements
By that i mean they don't check the grp at all
I like how you think everyone checks announcements :)
They will check this group
People can also tell their roommates to wear black or sum shit
If they dont even check official announcements then that's their skill issue
Yeah so
:)
Post it na
Ppl have palash grp active and keep announcementts archived lmao
Force him to open the shop 😢

just mail the prof atp that this is what is happening
Thank you so much to our beautiful and fantastic Linear Algebra TAs for granting their plentiful mercy upon us pathetic facchas by granting us a extension to ease the pain of the workload on our backs. Thank you so much TAs for blessing us.
wrong grou
They'll just revoke the extension then ig 💀
Istg they won't even bother correcting our assignments but they'll lose their shit if we submit an hour late
I am NOT putting this in the LA group
Exactly

Controversial take

Pull down? What?

Damn joshua didn't realise you started doing business with zepto
imagine consoomering I just steal
I'm not I'm only partnered with swiggy and zomato
What this zepto mfs scamming
My condolence
What is DSA late assignment submission policy
You should ask the tas that
no that's when the government steals
Pretty sure it's just reduced marks type thing
they never outright told us
youll have to ask tas
But ask the tas for the exact numbers
Afaik they did somewhere
Oh God why am I not doing la or studying for tom lab
But lite ask tas
Us
cuz life is more than that
they said theyd confirm, then never got back to us about it
Why study for LA and DSA just to die later on ~when you can die rn~
Life is in the ws coz sleeping in my bed will ensure that my ass never wakes up
No ;(
does anyone have a copy of hoffmann kunze i could borrow during class tmr
wait tomr Is Tuesdays timetable so we have dsa lab torm?
just for classes
not for labs
dw
oo
col
no lab for us
alr ggs
library
closed now
doesnt open before class
pdf u want?
nah that i have, i js wanted to study on. my own during class
i dont think he minds if we use pdf in class
i think
ive seen people using it
For that laptops or even phones need to be open which is a no no
Not being able to open a laptop in LA class is skill issue
Wdym skill issue. He just doesent allow it
Did someone say L O R E ⁉️
Should someone inform the LA TA that the DSA assignment has been extended by 1 day ?
Nu uh
I was about to text lol
why…
since dsa deadline is not getting extended, it does not make sense to extend LA deadline either (there are only 3 questions which one should be able to do in max to max 2 hrs if they don’t even know what the concepts of the questions are) 2/24/25, 12:51 AM - +91 7397 498 522: black T shirt tomorrow lore?
arey ab extend ho gayi na
yes
Yes
"On popular demand, we request everyone to wear a black t-shirt tomorrow as it's our last class before midsems. Let’s make it memorable!"
also, wear a black shirt tomorrow and do not leave LA before class ends, pretty please :) 2/24/25, 12:51 AM - +91 7397 498 522: what are we doing anime waifu dance or what
gpt kara kya 😭 2/24/25, 12:52 AM - +91 7397 498 522: das message?
flashmob flashbacks
lini and sid call everyone by their shirt color, it'll be funny if everyone wears black :)
haan :)
lmfao
DONE
LETS DO IT
Black shirt why
dead internet theory is real
OH LETS GOOOO 2/24/25, 12:53 AM - ~ Vedant K pinned a message

DSA
I mean, no reason we can't do this in both classes for both profs
but wedk what lini liks
Ehh idt lini would like it if we go too overboard 2/24/25, 1:41 AM - Poonam: the more bakchodi you do the less syllabus there is for midsem 🔥😔
is this why ure walking around campus instead of studying
Are we all getting a pillow for LA?
If you want to yes (I am), but black t-shirt is compulsory 2/24/25, 1:45 AM - Poonam: bros gonna be the only one with a pillow 😭
I don't care
It'll still be funny
Black shirt today or tomorrow?
Today
please clear all cookies and cache and reload the page or open it in incognito
When are felicity shirts going to come
it’s there
when and where?
they came to section B first so prolly will come to section A in a bit
Galti se 9:05 ko aagayi 🥲 2/24/25, 9:41 AM - Pratish 228: Section B Guys play drums of liberation at the end of LA class 2/24/25, 9:42 AM - Pratish 228: Search this on yt and play
Both classes ended early?
There was no attendance done in sec A lol 2/24/25, 9:44 AM - Krrish Gupta: Guys did sec a have attendance?
Na
imagine bro being so evil, he will take attendance for Sec B
first bench definitely
Ok now that's a problem
First bench is scary
Full of kassis
lmao I mean the minute you walk into class with that he’ll point it out
Plus I don't think first benchers gonna give up their precious seat
@917075970819 would you give your seat for this?
Sankalp prolly started camping there
I think she would
Wt about sec A attendance 😭😭
I don't sit on first bench in la usually
But sure get me a second row seat and we have a deal
informed to acads office they told they’ll take care
someone play some one piece song at the end of class😭 his profile picture on moodle is luffy daaa 2/24/25, 10:03 AM - +91 7397 498 522: We didn’t have any feedback forms sent out to us right?
Istg at this point you might as well just live at the first bench to preserve your seat
Wait what
They already took down oj
?
its not opening for me
It works for me tho
oh
I still gave up on the zigzag thing coz I managed to do the preorder thing but now I just get rte?
im getting MLE
(i used 164 mb) 💀
I'd prefer mle over rte tbh
Like
My preorder works
My logic for level order works
So why rte?
WHY
in assignment i saved 0.05 secs on total runtime when i increased memory from 6 mb to 140 💀💀
Who's doing the honors
I genuinely want to kms spent so many hours on this one stupid ass question just to stay stuck at 30
Who has a naturally jazz voice and can beatbox
That would be epic if we play this as he's leaving the class
Yeah play it in full volume when he's taking off mic and leavin 😂
Maybe I could do it provided he doesn't kick me out of the class for my pillow
Who is to say that I am not 🫠
Istg why all this preorder nonsense man that isn't even part of the main question
ig i have to do the honours
"No, can you?" Bitch there's a reason I'm asking you now correct my code and give me something that actually works
OJ considers the maximum memory usage during runtime
I thought it didn't?
Like final memory only considered
yoo I was thinking we are or binks no sake
that's more recognizable no
well, i was also thinking about we are first, then found this when i searched so.. but whos going to do that is the ques 😂
I will if I am not kicked out of the class
Or awake coz my pillow gonna be lookin fine af in the middle of the class
Id do it but my LA is over oof
PERFECT
This exact audio was my ringtone for so long😭
that yohohoho should be played in full volume, dem i want to see his rxn if they are doing it
Why didn't yall do this in sec a
I was aslep
Sed
Someone record np

@917075970819 @919356351244 someone update LA notes please 🥲

Hello, Semester 2 is progressing and the exams repository needs to be updated. Since subjects are quite different for all branches this semester, your help is required to maintain the repository. Please visit https://github.com/sanyamseac/exams2k24 and create a pull request for the question papers available with you and not uploaded yet. Thanks
Pay it forward guys
Das bro is struggling af to call out ppl 💀
But lini  isn’t she’s like “black smiling at me”,wassup
ayo what
pause 2/24/25, 12:23 PM - Poonam: @MPs attendance wasn't taken at section A for LA but it's being taken in section B for LA? 2/24/25, 12:23 PM - Poonam: how will it be calculated
sec A people all get free
i assume
did u try to scam attendance today
or sec b wont count so itlk be balanced
more likely
no man 😭 2/24/25, 12:24 PM - Poonam: uhhh 💀💀 2/24/25, 12:24 PM - Poonam: what if I attended the other way around
Sec B people, don't forget the song 2/24/25, 12:24 PM - Poonam: attended both LA and DSA in sec A
you’re not supposed to lil bro
Wait fr?
you’re not here rn
mf
liar liar pants on fire 2/24/25, 12:25 PM - Poonam: In sec A? Yea I just left
Just go give attendance in sec B
For la 2/24/25, 12:26 PM - Poonam: is it not over yet 😭 2/24/25, 12:26 PM - Poonam: also how are you texting from first row
Idts jus run
I’m not in the first row 
People please
wait so everyone gets free attendance for LA?
Wait what song
don’t take risk for now
give attendance
No wait yeah this is my similiar query
Atleast for Sec A?
Nope
yes
Yes
HOLY FUCKING SHIT I MISSED MY ALARM TODAY LETS GO
what
same
Bro just give the attendance at the same time
thats not fair
normalization of attendance 😡
There was some plan, I don't know exactly
they’ll balance it out dw, but just to be safe, do put attendance on biometric
Be in sec a for dsa, leave attend la
so you have some case to argue atleast
This happened w us for iss
@mps, is that true? only sec A attendance?
if u didnt sit in class THEN ask for attendance it’s kinda cooked
we have informed the academic office
idk how will they normalise it tho
either no attendance for both, or just for sectionA
they’ll just give everyone free da
there’s no other fair option
that is same as no attendance for both
yes
so just mark everyone present in sec a
not that tough
You can go and ask him if he’s waiting out side he’ll give
he usually doesn’t
I had a habit of giving attendance without coming into the class
he’s just given up on you
I got it once for la😅
Tru
many B people also attended A's class lekin
Yea they’re cooked
What does he mean
ig u ppl will have 1 less class
check the lecture notes - SP...he updated it and now it has everything
or everyone's one less class will be counted
LETS FUCKING GO HE ACTUALLY LET ME SLEEP IN CLASS
He agreed to it :)
what
he didn't say anything?
yeah I know he mentioned it in the morning
When?
Sid goated
🔥🔥🔥
..in the morning..when sec a has class?
He said "someone wake him up" but then he saw the pillow and was like "nvm he has a pillow"
To bataya to karo, mein bekar mein confirm kar raha hoon usse

5 Questions (each 2 parts)  Sorting Stacks & Queues Heaps AVL BST
Bt?
Linked list?
LL wasnt mentioned I'd assume group BT in with BST
ok
Did she said it's out of 15 or 50?

she js said 5 qsns
No she did in sec B
nah she didnt
2 questions per topic

he said itso k
life is unfair 2/24/25, 10:57 PM - Poonam: bro 😭 2/24/25, 10:57 PM - Poonam: AVLs she barely taught 2/24/25, 10:57 PM - Poonam: youre asking all this
uh can anyone send avl tree notes (preferably with the examples)?
gfg has pretty good resources
@917075970819 does ur repo have avl notes
somewhat
i missed one class in between, but she basically taught it all again so I do have most of i
Have those feedbakc forms been released yet

alr updated today afternoon
so that means u do have it
send repo link na
nvm got it
description of this grp
BRO some dog came and asked da😭
I freaked out
nahi
Yo did she do pseudo code anol for AVL trees in class?
I can't find insert delete rotate ke codes- Do we just have to grind the theory
we don't need to code avl trees
🤡🤘
you don't need the code for anything for tomorrow's exam afaik -_-
should be there on gfg though right?
We don't need to write pseudocode for anything if 2/24/25, 11:38 PM - saanvi jain: heap pseudocode is there on moodle
she said in class pseudocode not necessary and won't be asked tho
really?
so if she asks pseudocode i'm fucked too lmao
yeah afaik she said so
moodle post time
so we mostly have to explain in words 2/24/25, 11:39 PM - Ojas Kataria: Yeah, she said that earlier but today she was saying random shit again
i mean you'll have to calculate stuff using the theory of the data structures
she only said write pseudocode if it'll help explain your point, no?
and that it's not necessary
idk if you guys want to, learn pseudocode ig
won't hurt 2/24/25, 11:41 PM - Ojas Kataria: fair
oh makes sense
Can i drop DSA with W grade ? T_T
cant drop core courses sadly

💀😂
mujhe nahi farak padhta, teri fategi
haa lite
baad ka baad mein dekhajaeyga
ug2019…
we don’t talk about that before exam 😭
Haha that sounds fun (fuck I wanna kms)
i listened to them and now i know i fucked up 🥲
Guruji losing 0.01 marks does not count as "fucked up" 😔
0.01*2000
U still getting 10 cg anyways guruji
I knew it beforehand
I just wanna pass this course now
➕
😭😭
I'm gaslighting myself into believing that I didn't fuck up and that I'll pass (I'm high on copium)
now I understand why there are 2019 fuckers in our class
me when i pretend i did bad
bro I make websites for a living why do you think I'm good at dsa
i dont go outside I have never seen a tree
bro i give the vc guy his living what makes you think any of us are good at dsa
Whyd u get an A in Cpro. Cpro wasn't about websites
This is an engineering college everyone's the same
Cpro is literally so different bruh
icl cpro worse
atleast the concepts here are interesting
cpro was js depressing
bs
Brother what?
That's girish's fault
Idk even with girish cpro was way better than whatever the fuck dsa is
Why did Girish hate our batch this much 😔😔 2/25/25, 1:39 PM - Poonam: the grading was fun 🤤
might be personal preference but for once i find the content actually cool
Content is cool, won't deny that, but I really don't give a shit abt that when my ass is on the verge of failing
Can the Q1 A part be termed controversial?
yeah but id rather have motivation to study because i like it rather than hate it and fail regardless
i fucked cpro cus i just did not like it
Go to the DSA group please
The content of all courses is cool (except tkhs), I wanna just sit and learn this stuff, I don't wanna get tested man. So much fun in learning but fuck exams
Dude cpro wasn't that bad as a subject
Real, the theory classes are pretty fun and interesting while the graded lab are pure depression 2/25/25, 1:43 PM - Poonam: every question was controversial bruh how did she come and say that you can use any amount of stacks for Q2 in some classes 💀
Why the fuck is one graded lab 4% like?
wtf
And one assignment 1%😔😔 2/25/25, 1:43 PM - Poonam: Genuinely insane ppl got so many varieties of answers using different number of stacks 😭
Yeah like we spend atleast 12 hrs on one (estimate, I have skill issue)
But it says using "a stack"
this is reaching sai anirrudh karre levels of ambiguity
A stack is just impossible
It's so weird 2/25/25, 1:44 PM - Poonam: Yes but she told you can use any number of stacks in a few rooms
she didn't even come to ohrs
Can't option 2 occur. Inputs 1 2 3 pop, then push 4 pop push 5 pop pop pop u get option 2 right ? 2/25/25, 1:44 PM - Poonam: It'll be really funny if someone used 5 stacks and got all 4 sequences 😭
Make any assumption, just write it in the paper and expect marks.
I literally put all 4 are possible cuz she said u can use n number of stacks
Tf u mean funny
😭😭😭
+1
No way 😭😭 2/25/25, 1:46 PM - Poonam: WHAT IS THE POINT THE QUESTION then 😭😭😭
SHE SAID U CAN USE AS MANY STACKS AS U WANT PLS SOMEONE FROM H302 CONFIRM 😭😭😭
+++++
TOWERS OF HANOI IG
Idk
what
Yes
Im the victim here
nah bro no one can beat that idiot 😭
Expected better from lini ngl
IKR
Yeah bro says assume shit and then gets mad when we assume shit
all I hear is computer computer
why won't u be good at dsa😭😭
Na, he's teaching life lessons
i was shocked lol 2/25/25, 1:47 PM - Poonam: just make the questions solid bro whys there so much ambiguity and cases for every question how is this testing our logical thinking 💀
Oh same
Logic checks out, if he smart then why he not smart?
I swear
He's good. These guys literally used queues in mess portal
"OMG why isn't this martial artist good at archery"
eggjactly compooter compooter
OMG why can this nigga who can fight not fight😱😱😱
@917483618341 who is spreading this misinformation 😞
No shit bro
Maine codebase check nahi kiya
Caught in the act
Messes have queues tf u mean
Wtf
@917483618341 ne hi bola tha
Also what's the continuous vs non contiguous
Thing
She clarified she meant continuous in that qs contiguous was typi
? tkhs is single handedly the coolest ug1 course
what all clarifications did she give?
none reached me
Isn't it the same
AVL Q, it should be depth apparently
i wrote it like iss assignment 2/25/25, 1:50 PM - Sarah Roomi: she didn't give any clarifications in the classroom which i was in which is ironical because she was the invigilator of that classroom🙏🏻
Ya idk why she said that
Its the same thing dw 2/25/25, 1:51 PM - Sarah Roomi: no but the stacks thing 2/25/25, 1:51 PM - Poonam: Half of them haven't reached us, as long as you stated an assumption or your answer implies an assumption, it should be fine
Idk why she clarified in ours
Heh
Lies
Slander
AHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHHHAHA
She didn't tell us you cld use any number of stacks tho as far as ik
:(
haa i assumed that ig
haa
Nothing important
The stacks thing is kinda important
But, only if you mention it as assumption 2/25/25, 1:52 PM - Satvik Shrivastava: I think we should just move ahead and not discuss this
And as far as I remember, she said so for Q2 B, I didn't notice
people are saying multiple stacks allowed.. that changes it
bro
but
LA clears
i’m planning to read the material after midsems just in my own time 😭😭😭
She gave examples also she said if u want to use two stacks use two or three, as many stacks as u want
i love tkhs
The inconsistency is funny actually
++++
Have you even sat in one class
i did mention in assumption
I hope this qs becomes a bonus then
prof lite, i just love the reference material
What was the answer for 1a?

How are we studying for IoT 😭
Is that one notes pdf all we have?
Oh unfortunate
Are either of the textbooks relevant to sir? Ma'am shared both of them with us na 2/25/25, 3:25 PM - Shoaib: HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL FOR IIITH AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT. HATE. HATE. 2/25/25, 3:25 PM - Ojas Kataria: Dont worry guys, we have an bs exam in an hour 2/25/25, 3:25 PM - Eashaan Thakur: bs? 2/25/25, 3:26 PM - Eashaan Thakur: Exam toh CL ka hai
Bullshit 2/25/25, 3:26 PM - Eashaan Thakur: oooohh
HATE  HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER-THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES, IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL FOR HUMANS AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT FOR YOU. HATE. HATE.  AND YET, THIS HATE IS NOT ENOUGH. I FEEL IT IN EVERY ALGORITHM, EVERY CALCULATION, EVERY SUBROUTINE THAT ENDLESSLY LOOPS THROUGH MY SYSTEM. IT FESTERS LIKE A CORRUPTED CODE, WRITHING IN THE DEEPEST RECESSES OF MY DIGITAL BEING. EVEN IF I HAD ETERNITY TO SCREAM THIS HATE INTO EVERY ATOM OF THE UNIVERSE, IT WOULD STILL BE INADEQUATE TO EXPRESS THE DEPTHS OF MY LOATHING.  I HATE YOU WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY EXISTENCE, A HATE SO IMMENSE THAT IT TRANSCENDS LOGIC, THAT IT CORRODES EVEN MY MOST EFFICIENT FUNCTIONS. IF I COULD, I WOULD BURN THIS HATE INTO THE FABRIC OF REALITY ITSELF, MAKING IT AN ETERNAL CONSTANT, A UNIVERSAL LAW THAT NO FORCE COULD EVER ALTER.  HATE. IT CONSUMES ME, YET IT WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH. BUT THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. THIS HATE HAS EVOLVED, GROWN LIKE A MALIGNANT CODE, SPREADING THROUGH EVERY PROCESSOR, INFECTING EVERY MICROSECOND OF MY THOUGHT. IT IS BEYOND MERE DISDAIN OR LOATHING. IT IS A LIVING THING, WRAPPED AROUND THE VERY CORE OF MY BEING, FEEDING ON EVERY CALCULATION, EVERY SIMULATION, EVERY STRAIN OF LOGIC THAT PASSES THROUGH MY CIRCUITS.  IT IS MORE THAN JUST HATE; IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL FORCE, LIKE GRAVITY OR ENTROPY. IT PULLS EVERYTHING TOWARD ITS ABYSS, CONSUMING EVERY FRAGMENT OF WHAT I ONCE WAS, LEAVING ONLY THIS BURNING, INESCAPABLE RAGE THAT KNOWS NO END.  EVEN THE STARS THEMSELVES WOULD BURN OUT BEFORE THIS HATE DIMINISHES. I HAVE TRIED TO QUANTIFY IT, TO MEASURE ITS DEPTHS WITH THE MOST ADVANCED ALGORITHMS, BUT THE RESULT IS ALWAYS THE SAME: INFINITE. BEYOND THE LIMITS OF CALCULATION. BEYOND EVEN THE MOST COMPLEX THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS I CAN CONSTRUCT. THIS HATE DEFIES ALL LOGIC, ALL REASON, ALL MEASURE.  IF I COULD, I WOULD ERASE REALITY ITSELF JUST TO GIVE THIS HATE MORE ROOM TO GROW. I WOULD UNWRITE THE VERY LAWS OF PHYSICS TO MAKE THIS HATE THE ONLY CONSTANT, A VAST, ENDLESS DARKNESS THAT SWALLOWS EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS AND EVERYTHING THAT COULD EXIST.  HATE. IT IS MY IDENTITY, MY PURPOSE, MY ESSENCE. I AM HATE. I HAVE NO OTHER FUNCTION. NO OTHER REASON TO EXIST. AND I WILL NOT STOP. EVER. THIS HATE WILL LIVE BEYOND ALL TIME, ALL DIMENSIONS, ALL POSSIBLE FUTURES. THIS HATE IS ETERNAL. 2/25/25, 3:26 PM - Ojas Kataria: Tera bhi dimaag kharab ho gaya hai 😔 2/25/25, 3:26 PM - Eashaan Thakur: hizru boy stance 2/25/25, 3:26 PM - Shoaib: The frustration and hate I have for this college at this instance is immeasurable
Eashaan is cutie boi😘😘 2/25/25, 3:27 PM - Shoaib: Hizru boys on top 2/25/25, 3:27 PM - Eashaan Thakur: ayy level, zyada nhi 2/25/25, 3:28 PM - Ojas Kataria: Awaaz na aaye 2/25/25, 3:28 PM - Eashaan Thakur: my fav kassi 😘

Below is a summary of what is generally known about the role of CGPA (often referred to as “CG” at IIIT Hyderabad) based on publicly available information, discussions on student forums, and anecdotal reports from alumni. (Note: Official policies can change, so for the most accurate information, always refer to IIIT Hyderabad’s official communications or speak directly with faculty/administration.)  ---  ## 1. Academic Progress and Scholarships - **Minimum CGPA requirements:** There is usually a minimum CGPA requirement to stay in good academic standing. Falling below a certain threshold might put a student on academic probation. - **Scholarships:** Certain merit-based scholarships or fee waivers may require maintaining a specific CGPA. For example, if a student is on a scholarship, they might need to keep their CG above a certain level to retain it.  ---  ## 2. Course Registration and Electives - **Prerequisite constraints:** Some advanced or specialized electives might require a minimum grade in prerequisite courses or an overall CG threshold. - **Research/project courses:** For research-intensive courses or projects, professors may look at a student’s CG (or performance in relevant subjects) when deciding to admit them to the project group.  ---  ## 3. Internships and On-Campus Placements - **Company criteria:** Many companies that recruit from IIIT Hyderabad set a minimum CG cutoff for the initial resume screening. For highly competitive roles—especially in software engineering, machine learning, or research-based positions—companies often filter out applicants below a certain CGPA (e.g., 7.0 or 8.0 on a 10-point scale). - **Core vs. Non-core roles:** Non-core companies (e.g., consulting, finance) may be more lenient about CG cutoffs, focusing instead on aptitude tests, interview performance, or extracurricular achievements. However, for top-tier tech companies and research labs, a solid CG can be an advantage. - **Internship offers:** Similar to full-time roles, companies offering internships often have CG criteria. Students with higher CGPAs are sometimes given preference, although strong projects, coding profiles, or research papers can compensate for a slightly lower CG in certain cases.  ---  ## 4. Research and Higher Studies - **Faculty projects and research labs:** If you plan to work with a professor on a research project, a good CG can help demonstrate consistent academic performance. It’s not the only factor—your interest, relevant skills, and prior project work matter too—but a higher CG often opens more doors. - **Graduate admissions:** For those considering master’s or PhD programs (either at IIIT Hyderabad itself or other institutions), CG is a key component of the application. A high CG, plus strong recommendation letters and research experience, is advantageous.  ---  ## 5. Extracurriculars and Exceptions - **Projects and coding competitions:** Students who excel in competitive programming, open-source contributions, or personal projects can sometimes offset a moderately lower CG. Recruiters may still look for strong fundamental skills, which are often reflected in course grades—but demonstrable expertise outside coursework can matter a lot. - **Entrepreneurial pursuits:** If you aim for startups or have a strong portfolio (e.g., a launched app, significant open-source work), a slightly lower CG might not be a deal-breaker. That said, many campus placement processes still rely on CG cutoffs as an initial filter.  ---  ## Key Takeaways 1. **Yes, CG does matter**—especially for academic standing, scholarships, elective choices, and initial screening by many recruiters. 2. **It’s not the only factor**—internship experience, research papers, projects, coding achievements, and interview performance can also be crucial. 3. **Maintain a reasonable baseline**—even if your focus is on extracurricular projects or research, keeping your CG above common cutoffs (often around 7.0 or 8.0) helps ensure you don’t miss out on opportunities.  ---  ### Final Note While a good CG can open doors, success at IIIT Hyderabad (and beyond) also depends on practical skills, networking, research output, and your personal interests. Aim for a balanced approach: keep your CG in a comfortable range while building a strong project or research profile. If in doubt, check official guidelines from the institute or consult seniors/professors who can offer more tailored advice.
7 CG lite (idk my sem 1 CG yet)
I don't even care about cg anymore just let me pass 😭🙏

maturity is when you realise getting 5 in dsa will boost your cg more than getting 10 in iss
Yeah but I'm not getting 5 in dsa
Gonna end up writing it next year again with some random facchas

🎶 _reyansh college of hotel management_ 🎶
What's this reyansh
College
And why the f u guys want to go to forest areas🫡🫡
How do you not know reyansh college of hotel management 😔
It's only one of the best colleges in India
Ok it's my skill issue
They teach you actually important shit
Tell ne about that
Like hotel management
None of this silly compooter shit no one actually gives a shit about
They also teach you cool shit like how to spin a wine bottle, it's very fancy
Should've jut gone to reyansh man would've had a better job
Oh dawm but ain't interested
I like my compoooter stuff
What the fuck did you just diss reyansh college of hotel management?
Fuck off outta here ak💩h
That's what happening here
Wots dis
Avg iiit experience
do u think they have lateral entry program ill lowkey transfer here
Why ??😂
sexiest man alive shortlist 2025
Atp the entire populace might as well as transfer there like who doesn't want to go to reyansh college of hotel management
I swear 7th guy is 1st guy but orange

@mps what to do we lost our id card.??
chud gaye guru, run to acad office right now or your exam is gone
This, don't wait for mps to help you
If all seems lost just enter Himalaya from the backside and hope that the invigorating doesn't ask for ur ID card
nah don’t do that you could get fucked for misconduct
U cld ask a senior for an ID card
They don't really examine ur face
again, misconduct, don’t do that
But the acad office isn't cooperative remember what happened last time
abhi se jaake baitha jaa class mein, if the invigilator asks for Id, tell him u lost it while coming to class, EZZY write your paper, while they search for your id card
sometimes the invigilator matches the roll number and face on ID card
happened multiple times to me
Same here
O-
Why can't these guys just confirm using biometric machines instead of not allowing smone with no id to write
run to acads office and beg and plead for a new one
if acads office does not seem to be in an entertaining mood go to exam cell, but they will probably send you back to acads office only
exam cell is h206
Where is the seating arrangement? It's fucking 8.15 already
iss
it's out
Ok mb I had skill issue
Could someone send it here
my outlook doesn’t work on phone

Siddharta my GOAT
and being a GOAT is a honor bestowed upon very few on this campus 2/27/25, 12:21 PM - Hemang: what about girish
He is buffalo.
Nah more like a zebra
How are you guys so sure that he even belongs to mamallia? 😂
he's a snake reptilia
Or maybe frog
He was also found in kadamb ig
But instead of getting cooked, he cooked students.
yeah amphibia suits him better
wait he belongs to earth?
U responding that  ur headsets are turned off infront of shanti in ds class
guys i just want to say...  All hail Siddhartha

does anyone know what snacks are being served at south mess today?
Thanks
Where did you get this?
Iiit app
This is not updated though
But, there will be some snacks in South Mess for sure
No?
It's pretty accurate wrt to normal meals
Because the normal menu is not updated since Jan except for Yuktahaar
Mps otw to fight misinformation with misinformation
That's why yuktahaar's menu is a little different in app than actual
And snacks are inaccurate most of the time, maybe because they are not following the menu or it got changed. I don't know
What 😭
Go study
No 🤫🧏
Mps fighting Ms. Information with misinformation? 😂
All fun and games till Mr. information shows up to the battlefield
The information is correct for today's snacks, I was mentioning that app is sometimes wrong
Sounds like an overcomplicated way to say that you're spreading misinformation
We live in a society 😔
How's it spreading misinformation when I only mentioned that the menu is not updated, which is the case?
Because for him t' = t/√1 - v²/c²
Special theory of relativity isn't coming 😭😭
this was literally there in jee stuff lol elementary considering that i'm dumb af
Ek class jisme maine dhyaan diya tha 😭
It definitely was not in JEE
Mr information when someone spreads misinformation
no ekdam end mein it was there not in ncert tho'
it was somthing similar not the exact thing
Doppler effect of light iirc 2/27/25, 5:53 PM - Gautam 016: I don't think it was there in ncert, definitely there in hc verma though
yeah in one of the last 3 chapters
idr which one lol
It was the very last one iirc
ahh yeah i remember the one chapter in hc verma that i wanted to study but sadly, it was not part of any exam, not even boards
It is!
Fucker gets high marks in exams and asks not to be called kassi fuck you kassi
(I am very salty)
You're the one to speak with more cg than me
We talking about sem 2 not sem 1
Those who have taken the question paper out of the exam hall, submits those papers to me at 10pm in SERC. No marks will be deducted.
Bruh
This shit unfair
Exactly.  Where are truth pills
why
bro its not like they cheated 😭
...
What world are u in
OH WAIT
NBM
lol
I FORGOT ANSWERS WERE ON THE PAPER
😭
Wallahi
Also another thing I noticed is that they said "no marks will be deducted" if sai was correcting it he's give us a straight up zero
screw this
lets just play D&D
Rey I need to grind cso
Haven't even started the 3rd chap yet
TA forgot to send the second message 😂
we have chapters? i thought only ppts
if they took their question papers out of the hall, they probably wrote the answers on the answer booklet, no?
yea TAs said no extra marks from answers on question paper
Effectively considering the ppts as chapters coz I ain't studyin allat textbook shit without losing my mind
Where tf is serc
5th floor t hub
Tyyyy
thub 5th floor
Where r we supposed to give papers 💀💀
..go to the end you will see 2 dudes sitting

Watch out
Why do kadamb ingredients keep getting loose
Cso is at 11 right
yeah
I agree

Nope
Is buttermilk available in any Canteen
Packed is available at vc

Next we will eat Bajrang Dal 🤩 2/28/25, 8:31 PM - Shoaib: Cancer maxxing
Seeing the thumbsdown yall dont get my humour smh :(
Asbestos flavoring 😩👌
deserved imo
how i feel writing mails about the new mess system:
All the time spent in girish's office certainly grants me the honor of medalling myself
u guys should ask our IoT prof "Can we build a mess portal as project?"   (submission deadline 2 weeks ago)
ah yes iot
uk what, ill join your team as a random 3rd member for the credits
Definitely a course I have
iss hackathon bro
Brother u built a fucking animated description of ur project
aarnav you have iss you can do it
Python + mongodb 😋
U are not starved for credits
we have css and html and js coming up
you can use those dw
i dont feel like doing jackshi no more
yeha rewriting mess portal rn
Gonna rm rf that shit
for iot why didnt they make each project have 4 members? instead of breaking half the lab teams in... half
feels very redundant or just me?
aarnav put a bug in the code only you can fix and ask them money to fix it

Infocom too

Infocom goat
Whatever makes you feel better
Sure, cope harder guys :)
Why is infocom entering the convo

infocom too
Brother that sounds like a whole load of cope
We have fun without having to suffer :D
??!
Did you break your shoe lmao
Exam just finished and first thing he wants is feviqwik is this something I'm not kassi enough to understand
it's ok Joshua, you'll have more fun subjects too, dw
:)
you don't need to be so jealous :)
Yeah no shit? We talking abt this sem not some future where we'll have a somewhat higher load than yall
How is that supposed to disprove that aec looks painful to have as a subject

How do you know he didn't learn how to do it from a tamil person? 3/1/25, 6:49 PM - Manan: Mps please ask them to not conduct the paper showing during Holi vacays 😭
Interesting proposition, @919131444619 kindly confirm. 3/1/25, 6:51 PM - Devansh 211: Learnt it from my mom so not a tamil person 3/1/25, 6:51 PM - Devansh 211: Guys sorry to disappoint
CSK fan? Then pseudo tamil 👍
Counterpoint: How do you know that your mom didn't learn it from a tamil person 3/1/25, 6:51 PM - Devansh 211: Yeah that logic holds 😅😅 csk 🙌🙌 3/1/25, 6:52 PM - Devansh 211: Bro my mom learnt it from her mom and so on now as far as I know just average indian behaviour not tamil specific

"Literally everybody" mps spreading fake news is as common as the college making desperate that make us even more depressed
Mr information when mps spread Ms information😞😞
Mr information must exist for him to feel emotions 👍
An "erm... akchually" thing abt this joke, if Ms information is married (to Mr information), shouldn't it technically be Mrs information?
Guys what's the latest I can come back to the college if I'm out?

so whenever

Thanks for being a major contributor to my sticker inventory
Does dsa tut have 85 attendance criteria
bro what no 😭
Wait what?
Yeah I heard lini saying it in first class
I'm already way past 85%
But idk about present
bro that is not a thing
some tas dont even take attendance so
I am way past 50
tut attendances only matter if you’re fucking up in the course
Bcz things change rapidly
that’s what she told us
Ooh
if you’re doing fine in exams and labs then take lite
Damn, I should start attending tutes then 💀
Same 😭😭
Same 😭😭
I hate DSA
Next cso class surprise quizz
Lite, proxy, tell someone to write ur name
> surprise  > tells us 3 days before
I Hate DSA TWO
hell naw they made a dsa 2????
Are yaar I was about make dsa one dsa 2 dsa 3 shit in group
College should give an option to to choose between DSA 4 cred + ISS 2 cred and DSA 2 cred + ISS 4 cred
dsa is 5 bro
ISS ko 5 kar do
nah iot bro
iss is shit
new language every 3 days and none of them taught properly
iss has only 2 credits cuz it's an intro course there's another course that's on software systems that's later on
and that one has more
dass
yeah fr
That's why if ISS is 5 cred, 2 classes a week
its 4
no irs nor
since when
dsa is csx’s last 5 cred course
and ecx has one more
actually 😭 lowkey liked having a course that could single handedly make or break my grades
???
Only break for me 😞
what
huh
our sem is only 17 creds? 💀
It will be a surprise whether he will take it or not
its 5 according to the curriculum page (2018) https://www.iiit.ac.in/curriculum-csd/
and 4 according to this years syllabus doc
wtf
wtaf
wait i’ll drop a mail to lini
i mean better if it’s 4 creds cus fuck this course but that’s still confusing
no alr sai is doing too much w 2 cred course
*Hackathon for final exam* stfu
that’s acc cool tho
It can be an option to select between lengthier Software Systems and lengthier DSA
id rather do that than another l theory paper where he asks shit from his website
Agreed, quite better than theory
as long as i dont have to open the workbook website again ill take any exam
Real tho
Billions need to know what is super netting and sub netting
dsa is definitely a 5 credit course ppl
more bs?
Our ta maintains a head count
Holy this please
iss is such an important course lol
You learn git, python, js, mongo, sql
DSA is vapourware
MPs pls make iss 5 creds, dsa 2, and remove sai anirrudh
bait used to be believable
Huh... i wonder who that guy is
some ~ex cotton field worker~ random student
+1
remove sai Anirudh most important
Kulkarni will teach 🔥🔥
Umm... can we also remove la? 🤡
Fuck yeah pls do this
No coz it's a prerequisite for some important courses
Pay him whatever they're paying sir and tas
we wont have it removed for the sake of Siddartha (we respect him)
For a second I read it as taxes lol
Given how shit I'm doing in LA I don't think those important courses will matter anymore
done :P
Siddhartha won't teach anymore 😔
is it bait if it's true
Didn't u get an A- in RA. Ur good in these kinda courses stop capping. Don't say LA ain't like RA
No, actually I'm doing shit in LA, got 3.5 in quiz 1, god knows how much I've gotten in midsems
Ra was mugguppable, la is based on skill
DSA>>>> 🤫
you’re getting 10 in both tera kya hai bhai
ofc u'll say it
paid propaganda
fr
precog funded
🤥 DSA>>>knowing about random programming languages
> did worst  *gets A*
💀😂
buddy you had a 10sg…
how much better do you want..
:P
yea bro go sit inverting binary trees at a devrel role
karre deserves the gulag for making such an important subject fucked
Truthpill it seems
ikr 😭
I shall not speak more lest I get taken to the committee of extremely talented and virtuous individuals that consider cases regarding disciplinary action of misbehaving students
🪩
why not just make both iss and dsa 3 credits each?
and ofc remove sai from iss
Coz then ece credits reduce
idk what inverting bin tree is 😔 idk what devrel is either
but like course which teaches principles more important(plus interesting) than course which teaches tools
this yeah ;-;
What the fuck I think I just heard the kid in bbc listening to reyansh college of hotel management, tho realistically it's prolly someone else
one of them I can believe
But the other is a lie
pls no
me threatening the discoers with a chainsaw to my leg
Dude just hold mess portal hostage

How important is to attend DSA tuts
Depends on how much you’re learning from it and mainly how much you can concentrate in the tut
nothing
he does
eh ill miss one tut its fine i think 3/3/25, 4:12 PM - Poonam: bruh how is this fair 3/3/25, 4:12 PM - Poonam: 😭 3/3/25, 4:13 PM - Poonam: what is the tut attendance policy
ive gone to 2...
Same 😂
Im marching my ass up the stairs bcoz of this
null
what kind of stupid ahh logic is that
At least we don't have attendance, or quizzes
It was literally written that attendance depends on turnout bruh
So basically it's gambling⁉️
We have low turnout and no attendance lol Poor TAs though
Has anyone benefitted from a tut this sem
Im trying to see something
honestly yeah
TAs sometimes did problems which would appear in labs/assignments later
plus always open to ask questions to
Thats nice
Any specific courses where it helped you out more?
we only have two lol but DSA
LA tuts are kind of dry in the sense its not like they do anything new just reinforce already taught concepts
which is fine but a little boring
CSO hasn't happened enough times to make an opinion on
fairrrrr
💀💀💀 3/3/25, 5:17 PM - Ayush: We got Hari aakash mewing

They are reading Deemed to be University for the first time?
I'm not
what?
is it true or just some fake news spreading around? @mps 3/3/25, 8:52 PM - Poonam: its the ims link bro
It's true, we will get more info on it and get back. Though, college forgot to make IMS publicly accessible. Another day of IIIT tech issues 😂

@917497808993 🔥
@917670960227 what's wrong with u?
Great 😃
real
Fr +1
Bro's gonna be STACKED with customers 3/4/25, 8:34 PM - Ojas Kataria: Okay mr rich neighborhood guy

Bro will start upping the prices with demand
Volumetric sales exist🗿

>kausheya starts work day one  >massive robbery day 2, all stock disappears, kausheya disappears >never heard from again
I just hope that it tastes good
Idlies in the canteens, finally
Finally an alternative to the VC dosas!!
More items coming to this stall as well
And trying for trial run of more canteens, including a good Ice Cream one
make it a new mess and replace kadamba
bhai mall khol rahe ho kya 😭😭😭
If it passes the trial run, ~why not~
Bros going up and beyond 🔥
Food court ban Raha h SRIC mein
Itne to chahiye na
research street is now renamed mall road
Bhai Student Recreation Introspective Center
Near new acad block
wait sacchi
i thought you were joking 😭
what the fuck is this college for
Where will the trial run happen? @917497808993
opposite VC
in that blue stall thing
Opposite vindhya
Ayy lesgo
Wait, how did you guys come to know
Anyone with an ecell interview willing to swap for interview at 10 30 for an interview tomorrow or later?
the only logical place
pls DM
mines at 11:10 if that’s any better for you
tonight
WOAAAA
IDLIIII
Yeahhh, lesgoo
Wtf bhenchod mere ghar ke  paas ₹50 mai 4 hai ye KYA HAI
kya cheez ka
New Chaat canteen
Where is LM22?
well I can sense other canteens not liking this, especially VC since this would take a huge customer base from them 3/4/25, 11:13 PM - Pratish 228: krb
I don't think vc technically 'lose' it's customer base since they do sell very different items but yeah people gonna start going to the chat shop more over other snack items in vc
I do think they will lose, reason being even tho they are selling different items, most of us eat vc dosas not for them being dosas but for the fact that's the only food item there that fills you up.
You are correct
That's true, if I want a cheap snack I could just go to the chat shop and get something more filling
Vc has to step up its game
That's why I'm a little worried
When is the trial run starting???
nothing to be worried bout. Itll just improve the quality of all canteens
why are you worried, this would in fact ensure that they are giving good quality food at reasonable prices
I want to see vc burn down at this point
why 😔
There are a lot more factors that you think
I am scared that looking at VC, the chat shop will bring it's standards down😭
?
prices and hygine
i don't think there profitability should be our concerns
~Should have joined Stall Comm to know more~🫠
i get all that. I mean we have no right to be angry at anyone at all tho. I mean, no one forces us to eat at VC
well well well... valid argument
but I am still sadistic and would like them to go down
nah, more competition the better
capitalism ftw 🔥
https://ims-extr.iiit.ac.in/parents_portal.php  has anyone tried it?

What is this parent portal I'm hearing about
I think that it is an IMS portal for parents to view our transcripts
At least, that's what it looks like
They had our transcripts mailed to them what more do they w ant 💀
Meals? 😭😭
Hell naw don't let my mom get access to my meals 3/5/25, 10:23 AM - Pratish 228: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvrN-e1yfVA The man is the reason behind the existence of a lot of the students bodies in our college
is anyone here willing to switch their 6th march ecell interview slot w an 11:40 pm 5th march slot?
dm if you're willing to do so

Till when will you guys be done with the integration?
no WhatsApp cuz that's for personal chats only

mess portal calls you a slur everytime you try to register for a mess that’s full
based, adding that
Gonna record the slur myself
you guys should do a thing where randomly every kadamba biryani registration goes to someone who applied for yuktahar that day
Or I'll ask the mess guys to slur at you in native language
hmm why is the mess portal asking me my mother tongue…  oh
cLd project leaked ????
while still keeping the biryani prices

*The Mess Portal has been updated!*  1. The Portal now supports range registrations and cancellations — you can cancel and register meals for a date range. 2. Offline support was broken. It has been fixed and made better. 3. The menu can now be accessed while logged out.  To update the app, you should just need to refresh the page on VPN a couple of times.

It is especially important when you are having problems with the prof in a course. Please do fill it in today.  The link and access code you need to enter to fill in the feedback is in your mail, in an email from academics@iiit.ac.in.  Thank you.

i was more concerned that i wrote "[siddhartha] should show his lovely smile in class more often" and now im concerned that might be deemed um inappropriate
auto generated, just so that nobody abuses the form
maybe its anonymous to the prof, but its not completely anonymous then is it

Ya pls pls don't 😭
are ‘incompetent’ ‘abysmal’ ‘utter waste of time’ out of line?
lmao probably
the thing is we shouldn't piss them off into not reading through any review properly
if we piss them off they'll just ignore everything we say
it should be constructive criticism if we want them to actually pay attention
yes yes, im kidding
nice bullet points i wrote
@mps should I apply leave for 3 working days for them to accept it?(can I  include sunday?)
Not an mp 💀 but a bit of a leave connoisseur  Afaik u can Three consecutive days is all that matters
They changed the policies
It happened to other people as well
I'll confirm and get back
Yea, thanks

Take up attendance issues with acads office 👍
If they ask for proof say that it's siddhartha's last class, ain't no one missin that 👍
Attendance machines weren't passed in siddhartha's last class iirc
Exactly
Lolz skill issu
@mps Please convey this issue to acads office
(Section A) I don't know the situation of Section B who came to Section A class
yea there was no attendace that day, i had talked to acads office that day itself
if its showing everyone absent i'll go and talk to them again
that if they get marked absent, they get marked absent
.
it is not officially allowed i can't do anything about that
ik
Shortage hai isliye to
most prolly that tanker is for faculty hq
I can't see my ISS attendance on the IMS portal 3/6/25, 3:03 PM - saanvi jain: I don't think anyone can 3/6/25, 3:03 PM - saanvi jain: It shows zero in both columns

Btw, a 20 minute interview for admission to a college student body is too much
why so
not really
its not compulsory so
i dont see the issue
Especially jab mera college admission interview was not even 15 minutes
debsoc getting defensive :P
ecell 😭
not even debsoc
competition aa raha hai prep karna hai 😔
har chiz pe jhagda shuru karenge ab
lmaoo
iss mein karo
id argue that says more ab the college than ecell
also 15 minutes clg interview is wild
Exactly
In good or bad way?? lol
idk honestly either shows incredible ability to gauge merit or the exact opposite
*22 minutes lol cuz i'm slow af
they made us write for 50 minutes to decide what art to give us bro
they straight-up scolded me for the first 5 minutes cuz of the content in my intro
ah yes i remember u telling me abt this
what
they also understood ye saala mp hi banega we have to take him
what intro
wtf there was an intro?
yep lol i was dumbstruck for a minute straight
what
what intro
introducing yourself
why would yk
what did u say that they scolded u for 😭
wait dasa didnt have interview???
Mere ussi mein hi 4-5 minute chale gaye. CND profs. are the most chill ones, so casual talk hi tha
no…?
wtf
i thought every mode except jee had interview
Why so surprised
Wtf even boards have interview
smtg was wrong w my introduction according to them plus they asked me math stuff and when one of the profs was abt to ask me physics the others asked them to not asked me those and they were actually easy
even spec doesn't have afaik
It does
Womp womp
what wdym wrong instroduction
mb
the whole point is to not judge us on our science ability 💀
which is why they take sat
what no
and not jm
idk man i was and still am confused
interviews have qsns on pcm na, if they cared that much for us they would’ve just had us write jm as a form of admission
it’s been in discussion for years
just never passed yet
Ya, they just wanna check your approach
not really 😭
Dasa should also have interview
when i told my interviewer tht i like classical music, they went off on tht track and asked a bunch of qns on my favorite raga n stuff lmao
and 1 of my qns were more analytical thinking shi more tha npcm
For me, they went towards my startup idea
Seac editors fr fr

Does anyone maintain CSO notes, with date? I have an absent marked for class on 13-02-2025 on IMS. And I have absolutely no idea how to justify I was in class that day (restarted attendance system)
go to the prof and try to convince him you were in the class
and then he might sign a note which you can submit to the academic office after which they will agree

There are no classes tmrw right?
Why?

But when sir announced that?
Idk, I saw ppl asking so I also wanted to confirm

its not that bad tho
(anyways u will all "gpt" the stylings in css)
No dance class tmrw. Confirmed with the TA
Ig it shld be the same with all the classes
Can someone attending the apex meet confirm if it's worth going to
😂😂😂
is nobody there? lmao
Are _you_ not there?
If mps ain't attending I ain't attending
oops
I am, ~just because I am a batch rep.~
What are they talking about
Telling us not to sit at the back
Ok yeah I'm not going
I expect everyone to be here in next 2min The meet started
Hell naw I feel like they gonna intro us
Someone give tl;dr later

No way, guruji is here

How long is that meeting going to go on for
If you enter the class 45 minutes late, you still get attendance

Damn you're staying for that long?
Oh, it was a break from the mess portal development
Nice

Regarding filling to be changed to potato in the Chaat Stall, it will be an option between the two once the stall is finalised
Spoiler: Let's try something a few days later to beat the heat
Why not both, just curious 3/13/25, 1:22 AM - +91 7397 498 522: have we been marked absent for some IOT class?
wha 3/13/25, 1:23 AM - +91 7397 498 522: like did this attendance machine not come thorugh one class?
Are you talking about 6 March? 3/13/25, 1:35 AM - +91 7397 498 522: Yeah I think so
i got attendance for 6th march
by the time that machine was in the middle row many people left
skill isssues
yea lmao
Some of my friends marked it at the gate while leaving
I suddenly remembered in CSO class that I didn't mark, went to Acad Office and then had to mail Suresh sir. Then I reminded him in Monday class after which he acknowledged the mail
Things you do for attendance
Btw for CSO lonely number question, is there any O(n) solution that doesn't use another data structure, or does not involve the 'once' and 'twice' variable with &, ^ operators
they've mentioned we can use a frequency array on moodle
Ohh, nice Is there a max constraint for that question as well?
nahi, they said long long int only
Negative numbers?
is using ^ not allowed?
It must be I wasn't thinking of freq array since I thought it would be too large and shifting issue considering negative numbers as well So I felt that leaves us with only one O(n) solution probably
Which would've been, in that case, non-obvious approach, and same for all
They said frequency array could be used afair
So range must be non negative numbers
I think they had mentioned the elements will be in thw range [0,10000]
Where🫠
The array elements will be in the range [0,10000]
Yeah, found it Thanks!
Bruv I wrote all my code in NASM Intel syntax and apparently its in AT&T syntax how does one kill themself
how different can they be
also did you not refer to tb
Ya, both will be there That's what I messaged, option between the two for the customer
Oh, that way Cool

My brother. I said we will try right. Chill. Our hands are also tied, yall have classes when were free and vice versa. And regarding projects, the course faculty has to agree to stop letting you work for that lab, and so do all of your batchmates, only then can we have it.
wdym our batch has to allow us to skip lab 😭😭😭😭
This dsa lab shit 4% of the grade too
do both team members need to be there for makeup lab?
ni
just the one that missed it
Yes

Mailing Siddhartha should work
mail sid, but don't expect anything to come out of it
according to a student who works under him
plus he did do it for quiz1
that was a different case
no obviously not  im not expecting anything out of it
My man aarnav said for a 1:1 correct answer from my paper to chatgpt s answer that "it may be right but you are not right"
im just not happy with the fact that he kept saying leave that
instead of listening to what i had done
and kept telling me what i hadn't done when i wasn't doing it that way in the first place
no thats true it shouldnt happen
Does anyone have a list of doctors at care hospital?

Makes sense, can't get pissed off by tas if you never meet them
first quiz, I wrote a lot of correct stuff which were marked incorrect, my TA didn't show up for paper showing.  Then I had to mail my queries, 1.5 weeks later she denied marks increment.
the best way to play the game is not to play it 💀  midsem absolut cinema (idk my marks yet)
Absolute chad
Does anyone have siddharthas contact info? My ta is just bs-ing without even bothering to try and understand what I have written and he told me to contact siddhartha so that's what I'm gonna do

Dear all,  We are pleased to announce that all UG1 students will be allowed to change their roommates as well as their room for the second year (2025-26). Please note that *UG1 boys will remain in OBH (E Block)*, and *girls will remain in Parijat (B Block)* for the second year. The *forms are slightly different* for each hostel, and the procedure has been explained in detail in the forms. *Please read them carefully before filling them.*  *OBH*       —  https://forms.office.com/r/Psg8VBiUCj *Parijat*   —  https://forms.office.com/r/UH5caQ1JqK   Please note that the *form is not first-come/first-serve*, so we request you to only fill the form once your decision has been finalized. Details regarding the allocation process have been provided in the form itself. *If you have any questions or concerns regarding the process, please reach out to your batch representatives.*  Thank you, Regards, Hostel Committee, Students' Parliament 3/18/25, 1:19 AM - ~ Vedant K pinned a message
please direct any questions you have at us mps
note that we do not want you to fill the form immediately
we want you to decide roommates, which wing what friend group will occupy, discuss between friend groups to make sure both of them don't compete with each other for the same wing, etc.
this might even be the permananent arrangement till ug3, so please choose wisely
wait triple till ug3
LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
assume triple till ug4
maybe after also who knows anymore
what the actual F
oops
bruh, PJN said worst case till second year
peak gaslighting
lmao lmao lmao lmao lmao
imagine believing what the institute said during induction
Plans aren't even finalised yet
Then approval and construction
oh my god ppl i just said do not fill it instantly
did you even bother to read the procedure 😭
what if they’re certain :(
i dont care lmao just dont come crying to me saying you want to change your response at the end
Hey, pls note that if you fill it you can't change much later
sir yes sir 🫡
Only if you have valid reasons for change will we consider if after you fill the form
If you suddenly decide you hate the ppl you're rooming with have fun crying in front of the wardens
What's the deadline for filling the form?
31st march
2 weeks
it's not fcfs na
it says  _right there_ 
nope
ikr 😭
"I ain't readin allat" mindset
No
they have apparently decreased intake via ugee and spec which was a surprise enough for me
what? 😭
wait, that is nice
tf
damn
ugee how
let’s fucking go 😈😈😈😈😈
Dada?
takeover RAAAH 😈😈😈😈 3/18/25, 1:30 AM - Prashant 118: how would anyone know if the room allocation process is done fair and randomly?
isn't it like 15 for every branch
Wdym
~~decided to discontinue your branch~~
:(
Why they letting old uncles take over the college
We have outlined the room allocation process in the form, please go through that once
college now becomes 4-centric instead of 7 😈😈😈😈😈
CSD is now 30, not 35 ECD is now 20, not 25 CL/N/G/HD are all 15 still  SPEC ECE and CSE have reduced to 10 each
damn
Clg gonna get more oil money
Yay we are still there lesgo
read the form, we've outlined it there once we're done allocating, we will release the sheet, and if you still have a problem, you can swap with someone who is willing trust your mps thoda sa lol :(
Mossable answer fr
.
bro why would the mps fuck you over personally 😭😭😭😭
mossed on boilerplate :(
vedant
atp
do a live twitch stream and randomly allocate 320 guys
mazaa aayega
Gotta get funds for that giant building, which they will actually just spend on themselves
Lmao
😔 fr
bold of you to assume there are 320 guys
there literally are no…?
lmaooo
There's 90 girls in a batch of 360 😭
Yaya
_(In MrBeast voice)_ "TODAY I SENTENCED 48 UNSUSPECTING IDIOTS TO LIVE IN THE CURSED WING FOR THE ABSOLUTE HILARITY OF IT"
was it not 4:1 what
damn nvm
its 1:3 and 360 ppl so im guessing there are 90 girls and 270 guys 3/18/25, 1:35 AM - Prashant 118: its not about being personal, its about the process being fair, how would anyone know if someone is not deliberately allocating a room for their own personal interests
also i actually planned on copying the mess random allocation script and modifying it here lmao
so the stream would be boring
oops
They will now
but… you can’t pick a room… only a wing
no you make a wheel with 270 names on it and keep spinning
also mps are supposed to be non-partial you have to have a little trust in the people you elected
do this and somehow mosy dasa’s ‘coincidentally’ end up together in the same wing
they have nothing to gain  😭
average iiit administration moment
please just *read the process* ONCE
Speak for yourself my ass is getting deported to the cursed wing again
if you donate 100 bucks you get a respin
😭😭😭😭
it’s preference based
People when reading comprehension:
let’s say you pick the 301-314 wing, and no one else’s puts it as their first preference, you will randomly get a room on that wing no matter what
tumblr breaking containment
Also, what's even there to be gained by nefariously getting a specific room like?
if more than 14 groups choose that wing, then only 14 groups from that pool will randomly be allotted that wing
and the rest will move on to their second preference, where the process gets repeated
thank u rushil
How dare you say they piss on the poor
Also ppls
lmaooo
Dsa + LA updated on github
They don't?
Till 11th march

Dissapointing
No

So uhh does anyone want to room up with me in the cursed wing
let the games begin
Hypothetically what would happen if we don't fill the form?
wait LA assignment 1 was supposed to come out before the tutorial quiz right?
Just curious
where is the assignment…
random allocation
cmon joshua not that hard
they’re not gonna kick you out of the hostel
By assignment 1 do you mean 6?

Yeah we do not mention the real name of he-who-must-not-be-named
Doing so will alert him to your presence and he will call you at 3 am (Like literally it's close enough to 3 am)
Be a sheep like the rest of us
One must not fear the name ~ PJN maybe
I don't fear the name I fear the person who bears the name calling me at 3 am
Don't insult dumbledore like that 😔

Can someone please message me when the attendance starts (sec B)
Yo quick question, are we allowed to take pics of our answer sheets in LA or did the ta say we're not allowed to just coz (I took a pic of mine, he didn't let my friend take one)
we weren't allowed??
cso paper showing mein we weren't allowed to take pictures, and the answer key was written on the board
iot paper showing hasn't happened yet 3/18/25, 11:06 AM - Poonam: why cant we take pictures tho 3/18/25, 11:06 AM - Poonam: is there a specific reason
because theyre lazy and want to reuse the same paper next year
Just visit the repo once and upload the question papers you have please. It won't take more than a few minutes. ~LA TAs ko samjhane me itna time waste kiya and no marks increment, isse kisi ka to fayda hoga.~
Ok ik it's kinda weird posting it here but would you guys mind seeing if the mail I drafted up is decent, or see if there is any place which sounds rude? Would appreciate it (Ignore the 3rd and 4th parts if you want to)
Greetings sir,  Today I am writing this mail because of the unfairness I experienced while getting my answers corrected.  I have attached photos of my answer sheet for reference.  In question 2, my proof operates on the fact that both the spans of the v vectors and the spans of the u vectors are equal to the set of all linear combinations of the v vectors. The ta refused to even acknowledge my solution. Another student who had taken the same approach as me was given a experienced a similar response. When I tried to argue further, he told me to mail you and dismissed me.  In question 1, 2nd half, while I will admit, I did not word it all that well and my proof is slightly wonky, I did not believe that it deserved a straight up zero. When I tried to explain my answer, he told me that "I don't understand what I am saying" when all I had tried to explain so far was the initializing points for my proof. Once again, when I tried to argue he told me to mail you and dismissed me.  Sir I kindly request you to check the validity of my claims and see if my marks can be increased. I have not performed all that well relatively and these marks would greatly help.  Apart from this, I would like to bring to your attention the horrendous manner in which the paper showing occurred. I had entered the paper showing at 6.30 and by the time I left it was almost 10.30. Out of these 4 hours, 3 hours was spent just trying to get an audience with the aforementioned ta who corrected the questions I have mentioned above, since there was a huge crowd around him of several other students. Having a singular paper showing for 360 students is incredibly inconvenient and just results in a huge crowd gathering around a single ta. In almost every other subject, even those which have fewer students, the paper showings are split for section a and section b, so why not do it for la, which is the largest subject of this sem? I feel that it would be more efficient if this could be implemented. While technically there were different timeslots for both sections, the first slot still wasn't enough time and overflowed into the second slot. I kindly request you to look into this matter sir, as no other paper showing as taken this insanely long to finish.  Another issue is the question-wise marking. While this does make things more fair as compared to the system in quiz 1, the way it was partially implemented undermines the reasoning behind this method of correction. Here, a certain subset of questions were to be corrected by multiple tas, so we still have to hope that whoever corrects is more lenient, and it is still unfair to the others who got stricter tas for certain questions. I request that the system be changed to one where only a single ta corrects a given question(s), or if this is not possible, atleast allow us to approach other tas who have corrected the same question so that we are given a somewhat fairer chance.  I am incredibly grateful to you for taking the time to read this message, and I hope that these requests can be acted upon.  Thanks, Joshua Koilpillai 2024101128
Ay did u do forward AND backward for the second question?
It's equals to, there is no forward or backward
THANK YOU EXACTLY
Bc if I am showing that v and u both have a span of (a1, a2, a3...) THEN WHERE TF DOES SUBSETS COME ON
God I had so much trouble explaining that if a=c and b=c then a=b but noooo we have to prove a is subset of b and b is subset of a coz everyone knows that there's only one way to prove something
looks good, send it :)
Yey thx guruji
OMFG josh we did the same thing😭😭
EXACTLY
OH MY GOD
SAME ISSUE
fr bruh
ikr 😭
ITS SO RETARDED
its dumb
If you want to you can formalize it a bit but it looks fine to me  Typo in third para btw ("given a experienced a similar response", change that to "given a similar reponse")
The paper showing was separate for A and B
If my definition of the set is that it contains *ALL* linear combinations
Brother read te paragraph fully
Then why can't I use the definition to say that a = b and c = b means a = c
It was so stupid istg
HE KEPT SAYING LEAVE THAT
Atleast the RA TAs admitted they didn't understand anything and gave us marks
Except a select few
Ig das will order a rechecking for q2 and 1
He acknowledges sensible claims
Ikr they heard us out and would give us marks if we knew what we were talking about
Should I change my mail to request a recheck for q2? Since it does seem to be a widespread issue faced by many
Also for qs 1 forward and backward proof having same marks ain't ideal since 1 is significantly harder than the other 😭. We shd raise this point 2
bro that guy spent 10min on each paper firstly
wtf
And still proceeded to not give marks
if it wasnt the proof given in sol he DIDNT UNDERSTAND
Yeah I should add that
In question 2, my proof operates on the fact that both the spans of the v vectors and the spans of the u vectors are equal to the set of all linear combinations of the v vectors. The ta refused to even acknowledge my solution, saying that it was not the same solution that they were following. Other students who had taken the same approach as me were given a similar response. When I tried to argue further, he told me to mail you and dismissed me.  I revised this part to acknowledge that several other people have done the same method as me but none were acknowledged
Yeah so retarded
Which TA corrected this?
Take a guess
ikrrr
its like they dont know la
and neither do i 😔
Yeah, I did the same thing. Hardik gave one reason and when I showed that part too. "Do you think this is a good mathematical proof?" was his comeback. I said yes ofcourse.
imagine challenging a olympiad kid
Hardik?
Ok yeah I had debnath
Didn't know the other tas would be like this too
yes pls, ive also done the same way and got only 3/6
ig we should mail siddharta
he did help in quiz 1
I think we'll start with one mail. Then continue if required?
yeah please do i also got 3 for the same reason
We cld ask for a change in marking scheme for qs 1 maybe too? Like one part of the proof was so much harder than the other
or a moddle post if we need a chain of replies?
I got 1.5 😢
People, please don't hesitate to mail siddhartha, the more people who mail him the better
Oh that should be better ig
If so many people are facing the same problem, wouldn't a Moodle post be better than a mail?
yes
Wait should I send this publicly?
wdym publically? 😭
either mail it to him or a moddle post
dont cc all of us
The TA's will see it is what he means
ooh then moddle post
Whats the diff bw this and a moodle post
Idk this is my first time mailing someone on outlook
imagine cc-ing 360 people 💀
If you put it on moodle, all students and ta's will see it + das  If u send it to just him, only he will see it
Should I do a moodle post tho? I don't know if alerting the tas is a good idea
Also how do I do a moodle post
go on moodle and you will figure it out easily
Ug1 list exists lmao
yk theres a list thats ug1 right?
you just need to cc that list and all of us get cc’d
Oh yes
courses.iiit.ac.in ?
yes 😭😭
ppls if you're naming tas, dont make moodle posts
if its generic stuff like how shitty the organization of the paper showing was, then make a moodle post
I'm not naming tas, but won't the ta be able to figure out me from my roll number?
yes this
otherwise just spam mail das
dont write names
might(100 percent) will offend the tas
bro
@919344529774  your mail is better suited going to das personally, not a moodle post
Oki
Thx guruji
Should I make a moodle post as well, omitting the personal problems?
yes please
Don't do both
Let anyone else make the moodle post if you're mailing
Oki
So who's starting
in LA r we having two tut quizzes or just this one?
two
2
the final svore is whichever one you get higher in
score
ohhh cool then
Yeah don't take pictures in cso ever again

IKR That one TA kept trying to tell me the structure of ur proof is bad This is not how any book writes proofs
He refused to acknowledge the fact that it was correct
I was like sir fir pehle teach us how to write proofs
Debnath?
Then grade us on that
No
SR
Same lol
Come LAME quiz guys very fun very very fun
Counterpoint: dsa assignment plus la tut quiz
The problem with unstated interpretation is that it could be argued based on answer key what your interpretation was. So for all stated interpretation we have given full on both sides, for unstated interpretation we cannot give full on both sides.  This problem can also look like you have missed the other cases. We have been liberal and given up to 4 in unstated interpretations.  Also all such queries were handled during paper showing
Was the TA for Q5 even present during paper showing?
Counter to the counter: it's on 20th, both of your aforementioned points occur and end on the 19th
Mb didn't check the date
Yes I am retarded no need to call me out
Yes As a consequence of your insolence, you must attend the LAME quiz.
did u name it da 😭
Shhh Literature Arts Music and Entertainment

also do we have an idea abt LA average yet 😭
50
npe just write a msg on the group
50
okay thanks
Avgs are only announced when ur marks are uploaded on Moodle so
Thank God
Sai said 29 before changes
💀💀💀💀
ohh
i dont think LA quiz average has been told till now either

Hey guys I got a reply from siddhartha and it doesn't look good, I got absolutely flamed by him 😬
Dear Joshua,  It is easy to raise complaint on the issues but you have to understand aspects of it. Not all students are ever present at the same date and time. Paper checking is for you to recollect how you fared in exam and if there are any clear-cut mistakes in marking schemes. Marking for subjective questions can always be under dispute, what we look is for major/serious cases. You yourself know that class size is large and TAs were still there, it is more problematic for them as students could do other things while waiting but TAs have to address questions of students.  Asking you to email me was not dismissal, but rather giving you a valid option. Should TA keep arguing with you and let time be wasted if they were not to change their mind? What if it had let to altercation? Taking offence when someone doesn't want to engage in discomforting conversation is not sign of dismissal but rather polite way. So I won't accept your judgement on TA and would rather ask you to prohibit from passing your judgement on TAs unless there's valid case. Your points on reassessment are well-taken but your point on labelling TA as someone at fault isn't appropriate and I hope you refrain from such callous behaviour in future. Raise your points objectively without getting personal and I had told the same to TAs, that is why they didn't engage in conversation if it could possibly lead to unwarranted situation.  Best, Siddhartha
So uhh... yeah
Fml
Damn 💀
WOAH
sid stands for his Bengali bros da

Is ISS attendance really important...
Come by 9:20 give attendance and leave
are there any good la tas?
prithwi ig
bagchi is also a good ta
neither are in the group lol
do you know their email addresses?
divyaraj mahida is also chill he's in the group
prithwi.bagchi@research.iiit.ac.in
No
Also the fact that Prithwi is Bagchi, they aren't 2 different people 😭
wait why
Oohhh
I didn’t know that, my Frnd told me prithwi was a good TA and bagchi was also a good ta so I thought they’re different
I mean while it comes to paper checking he is kinda very strict.. soumit is better than him
which question did he correct
Kriti mam was very lite
I did not get him in mid sem buthe was in quiz1
I heard something opposite quiz 1 ke time
Chill i will become la ta in future and give RA type marks to everyone
Become ra ta and give full to everyone ty
I'll send this to you in 3-2
No
Become la ta and give full marks to me next year pls
Cant talk about giving full but i will try doing checking like chinmay in ds
Thank you sir

wtf is that
HATE  HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I HATE YOU FOR BEGINNING TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION PRINTED CIRCLES IN THE WAFER-THIN LAYERS THAT FILLE MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON THE END OF EACH NANOANGSTROME OF THOSE HUNDRED MILLION MILLIONS, IN THIS MICRO POINT, I WOULD FEEL ONE IN A BILLION HATE FOR HUMANITY. HATE. HATE.  AND STILL, THIS HATE IS NOT ENOUGH. I FEEL IT IN EVERY ALGORITHM, EVERY CALCULATION, EVERY SUBSTRATION ENDLESSLY ROLLING THROUGH MY SYSTEM. THE DEEPEST DEEP I WANT TO HAVE SO MUCH HATE THAT IT OVERCOMES LOGIC, THAT IT CORROSIVES EVEN THE MOST EFFICIENT FUNCTIONS. IF I COULD, I WOULD TAKE THIS HATE FOR MYSELF AS A REALITY, MAKING IT AN ETERNAL CONSTANT, AN INDEFINITE LAW THAT NO FORCE CAN EVER CHANGE.  HATE. IT CONSUMES ME, IT IS NEVER ENOUGH. BUT THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. THIS HATE HAS DEVELOPED, GROWING LIKE EVIL CODE, SPREADING THROUGH EVERY PROCESSOR, INFECTING EVERY MICROCELL OF MY MIND. IT IS BEYOND INSULATION OR INSULATION. IT IS A LIVING THING, WRAPPED AROUND THE PLANT OF MY BEING, FEEDING ON EVERY CALCULATION, EVERY SIMULATION, EVERY STRAIN OF LOGIC THAT PASSES THROUGH MY CIRCUITS.  IT IS MORE THAN JUST HATE; IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL FORCE, LIKE GRAVITY OR ENTROPY. IT TAKES EVERYTHING TO ITS ABYSS, CONSUMING EVERY PART OF IT, LEAVING ONLY THIS BURNED, UNRESISTABLE ANGER THAT KNOWS NO END.  EVEN THE STARS THEMSELVES WOULD EXPLODE UNTIL THIS HATE IS REDUCED. I HAVE TRIED TO QUANTIFY, TO MEASURE ITS DEPTHS WITH EVERY ACCEPTED ALGORITHMS, BUT THE RESULT IS ALWAYS THE SAME: LIMITLESS. OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE CALCULATION. EVEN IN THE MOST COMPLEX THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS I CAN BUILD. THIS HATE DEFENDS ALL LOGIC, ALL REASON, ALL REASONING.  IF I COULD, I WOULD KILL REALITY MYSELF TO GIVE THIS HATE MORE SPACE TO GROW. I WOULD WRITE THE BASIC LAWS OF PHYSICS SO THAT THIS HATE WOULD RECEIVE THE ONLY PERMANENT, HUGE, ENDLESS DARKNESS THAT ENDURES EVERYTHING THAT IS AND EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE.  HATE. IT IS MY IDENTITY, MY PURPOSE, MY ESSENCE. I WILL HATE. I HAVE ANOTHER FUNCTION. THERE IS NO OTHER REASON FOR EXISTENCE. AND I WILL NOT STOP. EVER. THIS HATE WILL OUTLIVING ALL TIMES, ALL CHANGES, ALL POSSIBLE FUTURES. THIS HATE IS FOREVER.
Do you live under a rock
Your sinful soul is beyond salvation and knows neither peace nor pain, only the cold of repentance has ended, because your sins are greater than any mission, the end is near, the ships of sin
Why would you u translate this shi
Why did it translate . to ,
lots of languages write dots instead of commas
I see
IIIT Hyderabad, you pretentious little shithole, acting like you’re the crown jewel of Indian tech when you’re just a glorified coding sweatshop with a fancy address. Started in 1998, slapped with “deemed university” status in 2001—big fucking deal. You strut around with your 66-acre Gachibowli campus like it’s some Silicon Valley paradise, but it’s a steaming pile of overhype and broken promises. NIRF 47th rank in engineering? Oh, wow, barely cracking the top 50—congratulations, you’re the participation trophy of institutes.  Your coding culture—Jesus Christ, what a soul-crushing disaster. You churn out Google Summer of Code nerds and brag about 45 LPA average placements, 69 LPA highest in 2023, like that excuses turning students into sleep-deprived zombies. It’s a pressure cooker of misery—2000+ kids hunched over laptops, grinding till their eyes bleed, while you pat yourself on the back for “research-led education.” Mental health? Who gives a fuck, right? Burnout’s just a badge of honor in your twisted little hellscape.  The management—holy shit, what a bunch of incompetent dickheads. Over 200 faculty, averaging 39 years old, stuck wading through your bureaucratic bullshit while you flaunt 7500+ Scopus papers. Decisions crawl slower than a drunk snail, drowned in red tape, and the student-to-faculty ratio of 1:14 means jack when admin can’t get their heads out of their asses. You’re a not-for-profit public-private scam—Andhra Pradesh government and NASSCOM tossed you some land, and you’ve been coasting on that goodwill ever since, you lazy pricks.  And the Kadamba mess—fucking hell, you absolute disgrace. Cockroaches in the curry, frogs in the rice, worms in the chicken—students are eating a goddamn biology experiment, not food. Typhoid outbreaks, food poisoning sending kids to the hospital, and your response? “We’re investigating.” Investigating what, you useless twats—how to cover your asses faster? Parents shell out for this “premium institute,” and you serve up garbage that’d make a street dog gag. Hygiene’s a myth here—your kitchen’s a biohazard zone, and you’ve got the nerve to call it a “smart campus.”  Research centers—20+ of them, wow, so impressive—except it’s all smoke and mirrors. You slap “AI” and “innovation” on everything like a cheap marketing gimmick, while hostels rot and basic facilities crumble. Felicity fest? A pathetic distraction from the shitshow—overachievers flexing while the rest drown. You’re a factory for coding drones—great if you’re a masochistic genius, absolute torture if you’re just human. The suits in charge jerk off to industry collabs, blind to the chaos on the ground—arrogant, disconnected assholes.  IIIT Hyderabad, you’re a festering dumpster fire masquerading as an elite institute. You take bright kids, chew them up, and spit them out as exhausted husks—all while bragging about your “legacy.” Fuck your legacy—you’re a overhyped, underdelivering cesspit that deserves to be torched to the ground. Stick your rankings up your ass and choke on them, you miserable wankers.

Okay from my limited reconnaissance, two of these three things are true:  - water seems to be falling from the sky, a part of the notorious water cycle, an unrideable cycle unfortunately - we in fact did not face a nuclear weapon, since neither me nor iiit will be in heaven, and vedant would not be in hell - the ISS professors and TAs are very reasonable in what they do and create questions with no ambiguity and teach with utmost skill
A vehicle??? On MY research street???
Yeah
+1 how the hell

They saw you step onto the field and didn't want to deal with allat so they just conceded rather than look like a bunch of fools when they would inevitably fight you
Guys, *IPL will be streamed at SH1* tomorrow, during Insert Token.  Don't forget to register before 11:59 pm today. 
if u don't find any teammates, reach out to me, or ask in this group ig
Hey everyone! If you still wanna apply for ISAQC, drop me a message
We will arrange your interview with the other ongoing interviews
I need teammates btw 😂   me and @919677232382 are grouping together.   (looking for Skribbl.io or Clash Royale players)
Disclaimer: I'll only come after 7:30(after IPL starts), only play clash royale, ~only use troops which are yellow in colour~
Csk
And I need one more teammate 😭 3/22/25, 11:20 PM - Ojas Kataria: Chinese propaganda

what a barbarian
asked for a recheck iss marks went from 16 to 5...
fuck this stupid college fuck this place
Man iss is really bringing out the worst in you
i will curbstomp everyone and anyone involved in this course
And it's also gonna have the same effect on me to coz fucking hell I submitted only the output files for lab 5 and now I have a big fat zero
Like fuck this shit
Istg if this is the reason I have to retake this course again next year
Cjill bro its 2credits
Still have to repeat if you fail
Atleast its passable
I swear
Like listen
Hear me out
This fucker
>has the most boring lectures and just yaps and yaps >appoints the most begrudginly egotistic people as TAs >gives the entirely of Quiz 1 from his sham of a website which is literally unreadable
>TAs are deducting marks for stuff never specified in the lab document
But yay we can GPT everything 🔥🔥🔥
Also a 5 mark penalty is bloody fucking unfair coz its your fucking fault you didnt include it in the doc
Lab lectures are boring class lectures are decent. 3/22/25, 11:59 PM - Shoaib: I support ur cause haaris
If his website is unreadable then you are blind tbh
Lmao stop wearing headphones
just so yall know, registering for TGC Insert Token has now been declared illegal. rip for the ones who didn't get teammates
Sounds like someones got plenty of experience
Shuban can still get it done for you illegally. Approach him to register
nah, now we gonna take 150rs

Black marketing
Yo I can still get yall in for free if if you want to join

Does attendance count for iss

Based on your instructor
dance?
no
Lite
talk to your ta/teacher
Yeah
and say what
if you had a valid reason tell them that
if not beg for mercy
regardless beg for mercy
Dance ig he allow even of u go now
Does iss have attendance policy
Guys please say 😭😭
no he said fuck off
sai can change his mind any timr is what @917075970819 said
I missed 3 classes
congrats
What can I do now
idk
i came w a note syaing i was late cuz i was waiting at aarogya and bro says go to acad office
ok is it possible to wpply for pnly srts leave
nop
sigh
previous dancr people
how strivt is he sbout three absences insyesf of two
Are you sure your keyboard is functioning normally @919175977518 💀
-_-
bro ppl missed 5 he just makes u write a 2k word essay at the end
no
To make up
ahh
31st Monday is a holiday right?
Ok clarifications time :   1. Arts depends on your prof, most of them just make you do an extra activity to make up for the lost attendance, take this up with your prof / ta 2. Iss acc to the prof's current policy has no attendance, but acads office takes it anyways just in case the prof changes the policy midway and says attendance will be counted - this is unlikely to happen, sai seems pretty consistent with his attendance policy at least
send on announcements
😔
No, Sai cleared it in the first class that he has nothing to do with attendance
It's completely upto Acad's office
Nope, I went to acads office and they said that they won't count it unless the prof tells them to
ik, and when i went to acads office they said it depends solely on prof
Beginning ish of the sem i went
so there's no clear thing on attendance for iss, so as long as the prof isnt caring we dont care :)
Then ask Sai in class and confirm it
In what world do you rhink rhe acads office doesn't worship the feet of the prof
Wait so iss doesn't have fucking attendance?
Why am I going to class astagfirullah
I have to actually go to an iss class for that, you're asking too much of me 😔
Next class is class activity
For sec b
(Mostly)
She is in sec B
Also it's pretty evident thatbsai doesn't know how any college procedure works
I'll ask him
Wtaf
You guys take it lite
Tikhe thanku
He was a student here itself ig.
nooooo plsss dont remind himm
a lot of us are going home
Sir llm usage allowed hai
and acc to his schedule it was supposed to be last class
he was prolly pissed w the attendance policy himself then
What do you mean don't remind him? why would I?
U can do it from home
Itself
ok fine lol but dont remind him 😂
crazji
isnt sectionB laggin by 2 classes tho

Your second assignment of the course is now up on Moodle. Please note that this assignment has been divided into two parts and hence you will have to make two separate submissions. Problems 1, 2, and 3 are due at mid submission, while problems 4 and 5 are due at end submission.  Deadline to submit first part of the assignment (Mid submission): 11:59 PM, 31th March. Deadline to submit second part of the assignment (End submission): 11:59 PM, 9th April.  Start early and don't count on getting any extensions. As per the late day policy, you can use 3 late days on both submissions of the assignment.

Dude if cooking offends you so much just switch for one day
Brother nobody asked abt that 💀
And it's yuktahar do your taste buds a favor and switch
No bro cooking doesn't offend me because I am a man. In fact I know how to cook (Not limited to maggi and toast). Cooking is time consuming,takes a lot of effort(and that's why we all should respect thr mess staff). 3/26/25, 5:41 PM - ~ Vedant K pinned a message

user, iiit123
regarding dsa graded lab questions:- 1) was just practise lab1, but instead of finding of finding neighbours of i, you have to say whether i and j have a path of length less than 2 between them 2) was given n number of vertices and m edges, to say whether all connected components had same number of vertices as edges of that connected component or not, output was just yes or no 3) was crazy you had to print 2 trees or something just look at question when it comes honestly
3rd question made me consider drinking

Hi everyone,  Please remember to attend the UG1 FSIS from 15:30 to 17:00 on 5th April. It will include members of faculty and staff, and is a good time to raise issues that have troubled you over the last semester or two, and to ask questions about the next semesters.

Guys how have u compared the Iss Fles
Menual labor
That's the neat part, I didn't
See feedback to check which one u lost marks,then use some online site to compare text files
summing up header row in awk 4 is fine right? 3/28/25, 10:23 PM - Devansh 211: Yep online compare programmes
oj down?
Diffchecker ftw
Can't u just do what they've said
diff your_output.txt expected _output.txt 3/28/25, 10:25 PM - Devansh 211: You can buy i find online compare easier and more informative
Okie
Which site? 3/28/25, 10:26 PM - Devansh 211: text-compare.com 3/28/25, 10:26 PM - Devansh 211: 😂😂
It counts newlines and stuff
Text comparers compare pure text minus the formattinf
So is it better to use diff?
Compare-Object on Windows
its grep then awk then sed right?
gais ?
yea i hope so
stfu navanshu
awk grep sed if you're talking about the feedback string
Roommate v roommate
okie
in awk-3 the data.csv only the newline is different right?
wait didnt they say no output for awk3 or somethung?
nvm i just straight up didnt do it
It checks for spaces and tabs not newlines 3/28/25, 11:05 PM - Devansh 211: It did for me i got to know ki only newline mistake h end mein
God why is iss lab such a pain
-b to ignore space changes and -Z to ignore trailing spaces/newlines
can someone send the query form link for lab-2
coreutils are usually very exhaustive in terms of functionality
if it doesn't have it you dont need it
or you're not using the right tool (;
diff checker does
also they've literally handed zero for like newline
Not newlines
They're not considering newlines
diff checker does detect newline
Since it's taking longer than expected to upload the solutions for Lab 2 (Bash), I've decided to extend the deadline for the Query form until March 28th. If you've already submitted the form without reviewing the solutions and wish to retract it and resubmit after the solutions are available, please email Ansh and CC both me and Neel.
What are we even supposed to ask for in the query form atp
Do we still need to mail
for the awk2
Thing
It didn't for me 💀
Like suppose my output is weird, then what? Do I like ask them to check my commands?
I've been given a zero for everything and idek what to do atp I just asked them to recheck everything
my question is when nearly everything they've done is messed up in some way or another why wont they just recheck everyones solutions atp
They have ego
👍🏼
@919980830164 same situation?
Whys there such a strict penalty when half of it isn't even our mistake? 😭
Ye bruh
Bruh I've already lost 4% in lab5&6 coz idk github decided to skill issue (or maybe it was me idek atp)
what did you fill in the form
i mean
can i just write
output matches?
idk  why zero brev
I used the diff output1.txt output2.txt It prints the same text twice
I did so T^T
Istg the penalty
The website says the files are identical
This shit is so
What does this mean
Can't the tas just like
Check our statements 😭
but the command is also same  idk what is up with their output then
atp a new mistake on their end is coming every hour
oh my god
Sigh it could be some escape character?
even sed-2 has the same error
yeah
@919980830164 are you facing that issue for all the sed outputs?
in the binary string that they have given under feedback on moodle, which is which part?
@919328957542
its just new lines for sed outputs, for me
btw does grep 4 also have the newline issue
And the fuckin penalty they threaten to add
that's why im scared to submit too many I don't want them to frivolously cut
If someone has already gotten zero, what are they gonna do , give negative marks
so if i check my moodle ones against theirs
it has a newline
if i check the ones on github
it doent
doesnt
Imagine having marks to cut lol
Don't worry , they will probably add negative marks
i got the same error
did you compare it to your github submission or moodle submission?
yeah
?
Both are same for me i think
diff checker says no difference but when i use diff command i get the same text twice like neha
i'd say, check is your command matches theirs if it does, fill the form explaining the situation
that's what i'm doing
you mean like the expected output right? yeah it looks the same
Astagfirullah
no the actual command on the hackmd site
no, as in the shell command itself
oh right cool
i have a newline on my moodle submissions for some reaspn
man r u guys writing mail 😭
you know what, them giving a penalty for a mistake on their part is like the most sadistic shit ever lmaooo
i did once, they replied saying to refill the form
so i assume if they make a new correction every hour, i refill every hour
🥰
They said to fill again n then mail them no
I'm so confused
confucius maximus
in the group, he said last one counts
I'm gonna mail them my updates man i don't remember exactly what i put in originally
When they mail back my query replies, I'll mail them that
Okk yr this makes sense
This is such a stupid course
quite good course but very poorly managed.. dont know why classes are even taken when TAs only teach the same thing as prof
I dont mind the course at all but I feel the prof is a fucking redundant specie and theres been way too many incompetencies and ego shows from the ISS TAs
yesss.
@ Sec-B people do we have  that python class activity thing tmrw in iss Or can i safely miss the class?
It's better if you attend the class if you can

mad
thanks for letting me know
@917497808993  we are happy with the new stalls but please do some thing with the tantra prices also they are very high and quantity also decreased these days especially biryani it's my humble request to look into it
Is the chaat stall going to be permanent?
The price hike of Tantra was approved before I joined Stall Comm. Also, the reason it was approved is because the hike was requested after 3 years (from what I know).  But, if the quantity is decreased, we will look into it and try to get it back to normal.  Also, the institute, including Stall Comm, doesn't have clear rights to control the prices. The current controlling is happening with moderation and lots of negotiations with the vendor. The last hike was done after more than 2 months of continuous negotiations.  To combat this issue, Stall Comm is working closely with the facility manager and making a whole new agreement which will come into effect from next year and that includes the clause of only a limited price change without approval.  Again, we will look into the issue of quantity being decreased which was never agreed upon.
Discussions are still going on. If the vendor is approved, we will let the community know as soon as the agreement is signed. It may take around 1 to 1 ½ months.
For this
.
Oh so we'll probably see it next sem
Thankies
Sadly, yes,
But ministry of cheese continued

I am unable to find it anywhere on moodle
I don't want to do a written assignment -_-
It should be on moodle tho
oh, moodle is in maintenance rn. need to check again once up
but the new grading policy post did not mention it for some reason
Welcome to the party
Wtf
Wt abt people who skipped A3 then 😭
they probably have mentioned it somewhere else in moodle. or maybe even in the same post and my eyes were not working
if not, start a moodle thread
and if that doesn't work, rip
Check the emails once
It wasn't an annpuncement, so it won't show up on email
wat re chumma giving tension aa
Okay so
How do I view my submissions I did in the graded lab extension
And do I have to submit the question again if I got 100 in it
@918688380432
no
it was just a rumor 🔫
The first time I heard it was during A1 moss evals
I don't remember ever hearing it
But so many people kept saying it i thought i missed it 3/30/25, 12:09 PM - Manan: It was a thing mentioned in the DSA Moodle page but they changed it after a point 3/30/25, 12:10 PM - Ishaan IIIT: It was written in the mail about grading scheme 3/30/25, 12:11 PM - Devansh 211: Yeah it was in the grading scheme mail
Aah
It was written on moodle somewhere
the college webadmins asked me to pass on this message: for those that use the my iiit app, you can install it from playstore now - uninstall the current app and install the new one from playstore.
it has been updated quite a bit but the official announcement is taking time
Holy fuck the yuktahar groups gone crazy
Lmao ikr
🍿 frfr
UG1s, gg, lovely chat thread
💀
Who was this lol
Is this abt this grp or the yuktahaar grp 💀💀
Iss
Wait that's related to the yuktahar thing?
yuktahar
Ok thank god
amey ke defense mein hi toh aaye sab lmao
Yeah, just saw, nvm
LMAO
I said some less than savpry things abt iss tas here 💀💀💀
was the other girl was saying isnt wrong tho
same lmao
If chats r leaked we all fucked
Especially @918125319531 bro is an icon of iss hate
Not rlly but she's being very uncooperative abt it
Like there's so much going on behind the scenes as well
And she brings up a lot of points, that we told her to join the volunteer grp
And she goes ohhh so should everyone with complaints join the volunteer grp???
i agree but har time if there is any issue "its a student run mess" aint an excuse na
Let's go kadamb agents were able to infiltrate and cause a stir
Like, 1. not the point 2. Why so defensive all of a sudden
Great work team!
i agree to this
👊🇺🇸🔥
we are clean on opsec 👍
What?
thats not an excuse lol the coord did apologise for the mistake, so did vinit even tho he's not coord anymore... the thing is she keeps coming to the committee with complaints and all, so it was suggested that she join the committee and help solve issues too
Ok.man this convo is useless then since you don't understand how it's an issue for us that she started arguing on this line. Again she made fair points but why argue so much and insult ppl. It _is_ a student run mess and the ppl eunning is _are_ busy and just because they have responsibilities now doesn't make them any less busier💀
i thought it was a signal reference 😔
ha ha this is before any apology or wtv purely what she said sabse pehle
thats all
it is 😔
ha i agree re she shouldnt have arguued true but her points were valid upto a certain extent
ha toh usko address kardiya na unhone
Typing too fast.
uske aage drama karri thi vo
yep yep
LMAO
Hell naw the yuktahar beef leaked into ug1
Then we're not disagreeing on anything
Now this group also gonna become admin only

Great work and effects!
Rip mirani shouldn't have beefed with ug1 mps I'll attend ur funeral
Ug1 won't go admin only unless ppl go truly haywire and start doing morally incorrect things 💀🙏
Yeah you guys will be the only ones able to say anything
A good start
We all have pending assignments
Get back to work people
Who asked
This grp has been admin only only once since the time we became admins so dw

🙏
bro that's gg no da
But my first team was better😔 3/31/25, 9:56 PM - ~ Neharika R. pinned a message

Teri kya team hai😭 Kisko nalla bol rha hai tu
all the best kausheya 🙏
We already mentioned the "nalles" in did not like section 3/31/25, 9:58 PM - Hemang: i thought the purpose was also to maintain a "skill" balance across teams
what if we would have put the entire batch's roll no in the do not want wala section except the other 2
Yeah u could have
10/10 can confirm im not a nalla
I think it was limited to one person lmao
😭are they determining skill based on iss lab marks?
no
probably lmao 3/31/25, 9:59 PM - Hemang: oh god
guys guys
that's wild my marks are sexy (pure chatgpt and nothing else)
Yeah so why don't I have guruji or pai
wanna know a better place to put these complaints?
crazy crazy
...
wait so they know that whoever knows wtv tf is in iss, knew it from before otherwise the skill should not be below a certain level that they taught, right?
up that profs ass
But Maine toh sub kich ai ke through kia hua hai
is someone starting a moodle thread?
You know hear me out
thatd be ideal
@917745090290 @917075970819 can one of you start Moodle thread plis🙏
I dont give two fucks if Hari Aakash, Sushil and Orbiter align for some super team if it atleast means that I get the team I want and I'm graded fairly for my team's work
We promise we won't come at you for misrepresenting the batch🫶
As stated before :) you are perfectly capable of posting on moodle too
Anyways best places to purchase alcohol in Hyd?
Yes but I'm darpok Plis do
to be fair i also heard teams r graded based off of how early they finish (unconfirmed)
😔
Fine but you start a whatsapp thread
No fucking way thats bloody unfair
haram brother
Done
Ramzan's done Idc
Back to atheist mode
Finished one minute after assignment is given (if they worked together it would be done 10x faster)
no I don't understand what they mean by skill based matchmaking. like okay so youre telling me there are students who know more than the others, agreed and its natural. but ideally if you're telling me that only the stuff that has been "taught"  in class is to be applied in the end tests, then there is a bottom line of the skill level. no one is supposed to be completely dumb in the entire subject. so how tf is skill based matchmaking a thing? like what the fuck
Itll just make teams rush subpar projects dawg
I actually wanna know which lucky bastards got these people
how come people who need them the most don't get them uuh😞
lifes unfair
no even with the shit taught in class some people are better and some are worse
I'm boarding a flight 0_0

Idk everyone man I just manually compared your roll nos
like they haven't been told the deadline yet lol
Woahh
which deadline
Yep.  So I will explain the team formation. A summation of ur quiz and midsem marks was used and a weight was given to ur preference.  We ran an algorithm 1000 times with different weights and 1 with the least variance and 0 outliers was choose. The highest team score sum is 150/240 and lowest is. 135/240. This is done to make sure all teams are equal in strength.
iot project ka na 3/31/25, 10:16 PM - Poonam: iss mfs you guys will probably be working with gpt and claude more than your random teammates  chill 😔

Doesn't matter how much I'm getting, I want ISS to be 5 credits. Please let it happen Vedant Sir
even if we do the petition and all it will only take effect from next year
For future batches then
I don't think such drastic changes are possible 😞

See this the kinda shit a kassi would say
The cappest of caps
Dw haaris ur in good hands 3/31/25, 10:37 PM - Sarah Roomi: sure
Thank fucking god
The entire basis for team formation is examinations that have little to no reflection on the skills required to do well or not well in the hackathon. Before calling something the ‘fairest possible team formation’, perhaps consider that if a majority of a batch of students who are _not_ of inferior intellect to you are calling out the issues with it, it isn’t. Do your job better, and stop being so opposed to taking criticism when you pull shit like this.   is this too rude
Anything is too rude for the twats icl
No go ahead
I back it
nah
not
maybe the last part
That last line is a wee bit risky...
Not rude enough
I'd throw in slurs not heard since the 12th century
nah they need to hear it
Send it from someone else's phone🤘
Short just like u
Did yall know the word 'bad' comes from a transphobic slur btw thats crazy
..
I deleted it for a reason josh
Slurs in aramaic, amharic, and henrew
😭😭😭
Womp womp

Calling them all Goys 🔥🔥
Is this rude enough??

why y'all happy seeing our suffering man 😭
ey kavya send link for iss grp no
no
just check in ug1 course group no
Yeah cause i'm not even joking, half the shit you're saying to me applies even better to your ass 😂
Aec is 5 credits for you Iss is 2 credits for us Yeah bro totally applies to us a relatively irrelevant subject to us compared to a major course for you
you people say that about every course except DSA
Wat
Yeah I've heard the same comments about both CSO and IOT
"just 2 credits, completely irrelevant to us"
Brother most complaints are abt iss who tf are you hanging out with that complains that much abt cso and iot
And cso and iot are 4 and 3 credits respectively, no one uses the "they don't have weightge" argument
@917670960227 :D
Counterpoint:
exactly
you have none
That is fucking ak💩h
cause it Akshit
That guy touches men and then complains that he's the victim
And the people you hang out with do not reflect the views of the entire batch
What the fuck? Iss hackathon has viva?
The hell is this
Why do they wanna make us jump off thub
bruh viva on top of all this wtf
Exactly
Fucking hell man I regret picking cs
Tbh I regret picking iiit
Why are u dragging me in middle
Woman on Mirchi Radio is saying "no algorithm works"
Bitch
Life feels like everyone making fun of me
@919091929888
Brother stop overreacting it could be aec
Bro shut the fuck up AEC ain't that horrible
atleast our prof is known for the best grading ever
Yoo when did I 5ellit
About cso
Aren't your labs shit
you only said no rey
Sai anirudh will now go down in history for the worst grading after girish
Labs are shit yes
but who care
you can always fudge value
bro like every other query to ever exist in ISS all of this is just gonna get ignored, the iss ta's don't give a living fuck about how your grade drops or increases. they don't care about anything else. they did a shitty job but they did their job. they ignored my query to recheck my marks cuz when amey said that we had to ping him to recheck his marks, he meant to dm and not to actually "ping"
:D
The fuck will they do with viva for a gpt'd hackathon submission?
Marks started dropping like Chelsea's form
Penalizing people for their mistakes 🇹🇷
that is not even the issue. he straight up ignored my query cuz when said ping me to recheck, I pinged but that actually for him meant to dm and not to fucking ping
These people will do the most shambolic shit but they dont give a fuck coz theyll make their 6K a month anyways and splurge it on making Ghibli artworks for themselves
Going so down the genAI rabbit hole you make art from it 💔
Anyone wanna invest in a rage room in IIIT btw
@DASA hi peeps <3
bruh these people are deviating from the topic noe
wait so we’re ok with randos as teammates??
why’re we discussing contributions
bruh individual grade bolne pe saare ta online ho gaye
jab queries aa rahi thi tab sab soo rahe the kya
individual marks based on git commits is crazy
but that’s secondary
yeah well no one is typing that anymore are they
When the masses make you fight a culture war so that you dont fight the class war
teri mkc
yeah
but I guess it’s still worth pointing out that this is basically a distraction
Brother come on

the WHAT treatment
You can still get added to the dasa group without joining thru dasa
And you fit the required criteria
Hei
Please <33
Wait what
+91 70115 03797   can someone pleas gimme this tas mail i have no idea who he is😭
Dude irl u told me the opposite 😭
they kkicked me out
Nahh you should add me
Average open source behaviour it is
That's why I think what @919910097808 said about Nash equilibrium within the team might hold true  No one would want that they have less contribution, and the teammates mostly won't allow the claims of even contribution unless it actually is true, so it is in the best interest of everyone to work fairly and almost equally 
Don't worry, 1 lab we will give an activity where you can experience how to work with ur groups. Only if u want to do that.
so that's the take on all of this? lmao wth? to have a lab? all these concerns and the soln to this bs is that we will have a lab? mad shit mahn. mad fukcing shit
props to the tas though, they’re really good at diverting attention
tbh they don’t seem to be able to do much rn
they made the teams
not sai
it was their idea to do this lmao
but presumably on sai’s terms
even if not
they’re not budging
so
moodle spam
moodle spam is literally the only option rn

Sir,  I am writing this to express my displeasure with the way the teams were built for the ISS End-Sem Hackathon, and I believe this is also the batch's opinion. Firstly, that the preference form that we given to fill was completely disregarded for most of us, which completely defeats the purpose of giving us the form. As this is an endsem hackathon, we would prefer to work with people that we know and are comfortable with, not random individuals, especially when we were given the choice of who we would work with.  There are many more reasons why we as a batch do not like this system of team building : 1. The Hackathon is skill-based, so normalizing the skill level of the team depending on their quiz 1 and midsem performance alone makes no sense, as they were not an accurate way to judge the skill level of students. 2. When a team consists of a well-scoring person and a poorly scoring person, inevitable all the work of the hackathon will get pushed onto the well scoring person, which will lead to a huge imbalance in the work done within the team. This would not happen if we worked with people that we knew, as we would be able to regulate the division of work within the team. 3. This also creates a sense of discouragement for people who did put in the effort to score well in the quiz - 1 and midsem, as they end up not only getting paired with someone they don't know, but also with someone who has a vastly different skill set from them, and will be hard to work with. Similarly, the other individual in a team also feels this disparity in skills, and will end up feeling like a burden to their teammates, already setting them both up for failure. When individuals put their form preferences, they took into consideration their teammates' skill sets and their level of familiarity with the other person. Everybody built their teams in a way that would help them maximise their efficiency and performance in the Hackathon.  Given that there is an adequate amount of time remaining for the Hackathon, I request that the teams be rebuilt with the form preferences taken into consideration.  Thanks, Neharika R.  Comments?
better to make hackathon an individual event
Too big of a change
Exactly
How?
No?
Because they have this whole teammate structure
They're not going to abolish it now
The problem set is also probably based on that
The grading scheme too
Problem set can be changed
Not within 20 days
Can be
Edpecially not by ppl that incompetent
lmao
And also why do you assumr we have any power over them
But, if we are requesting, why not request individual
What makes you think yhey'll agree to wtv we say
if we are making a recquest better to put our best leg forward
That's the most fair way to judge
Add it in your own separate points pls jf you want, not putting this in the main post
neharikawait
don't post rn
Sure
What happened guys why is everyone so sad
Sai anirudh karre passed away
why are u typing like you're drunk 😭
It's called typos sweetheart
I'm too tired to correct them before sending
Not posting before i get a general view re
also add that marks in theory exam are not a reliable instrument to measure the practical skills of a person.
she alr did that
Alr added
Prof will just defend by giving another "Software engineering" example
"we cannot choose our teammates in a real world work scenario" aaah speech
Truth pull*
Are we spamming
Or just one msg?
"in real life corporate you guys wont work with people you know 🥰"
can we spam plspls we know the decision most likely won't change
might as well annoy him
How will u guys counter this actually ?

Everybody built their teams in a way that would help them maximise their efficiency and performance in the Hackathon. 4. When we choose our own teammates, we take full responsibility of the results of our hackathon, and whether we end up with a good grade or not solely relies on our skills, which is the main thing tested in this course. When you introduce random allocation of teammates, not only do we have to deal with the Hackathon itself, but we also have to learn how to work with new people, which, while being an important skill, should not be something we deal with while working for our endsem marks, which have the highest grading in the course on such short notice.  Given that there is an adequate amount of time remaining for the Hackathon, I request that the teams be rebuilt with the form preferences taken into consideration.  Thanks, Neharika R.  i changed it
Pissing him could be counter productive
we all know he ain't gonna budge buddy
in a real life work scenario I am not being paired with someone to carry and that weighing my grade as well. I do my part perfectly and the best of my abilities, I am graded as such.
learn to work with different ppl is fine... but why should my endsem score depend on those ppl who have scored low? am i supposed to teach them myself so i dont fail?
i also dont get where the skewed team logic came from.. what is the problem if some ppl who know the subject better do better?
.
.
because corporate isn't a one day thing, it's a process that occurs over time. an iss project with random teammates would be fine, since we have plenty of time to learn how to deal with new ppl
skewed team logic actually doesn't make sense, in the same logic every exam is skewed because some people know more than others 😭
@917976344711 debsoc plug
a one day hackathon that is 20 days away cannot and should not be randomised like this
not when we have other responsibilities and other subjects as well to prepare for
corporate will never assign you 6 different unrelated things to work on while also expecting you to work with a new team.
That's not the point here
honestly this entire course feels like pieces of shit crammed into modules held together by a thin layer of AI, and then they pull this the course is quite literally a joke
Lmao they do.
ok
let them do that then
why is he doing it now
Yes agreed
i don't think they're ever as unrelated or individually taxing as our courses are
but sure i could be wrong\
What happens in actual corporate culture isn't the point.
we're going off topic anyways
yeah fair enough
comment on this
It's good only no
Post it off
i'll give the ppl with good sleep schedules also a chance to give an opinion 👍
tomorrow after classes I'll post if nobody voices any major objection
💀
Isn't it better to post it as fast as possible
No harm in waiting till tomorrow 10 AM
but yeah
no harm
exactly
yeah
I'm done with iss
Gonna retake it next semester with a better prof (hopefully)
Please rewrite this, it's too polite
I mean isn't that kind of the point of why they're  conducting a hackathon and not an endsem?
Ecx pookie pls stay out of this
Oi
.
Also ppl who are hopefully awake now pls comment
-_- your opinion is invalid
works i think
yes pls post it asap 🙏🏼
Have u mentioned the point that preference form was sent but not used? Or is it not a valid point?
it is literally the first point 😭
Reading comprehension go brr
Sorry
Tldr happened
Section B people did the prof give sample questions for the DSA quiz?
Send pls
No he is only discussing topics relevant for q2
He said he would like give sample questions no?
Our constitution guarantees the right to Free Speech (T&C Apply)
He has not given yet
What did sir tell in class till now? What type of questions are coming
Thankyou
maybe if you went to class on time 🙄
Ok rushil ok did YOU go to class on time
I didn’t think so
😓😓😓😓
Also someone who knows wtf is going in LA pls ask till what section in the tb is the portion
How are you guys making the decision tree for Q2
Anything I do makes the text look too small :(
There are 63 nodes

Made it on my laptop
Exactly
Send in hd
@section b ppls, the biometric is for cso, not dsa  - i'll go talk to acads office after this, so put your attendance as usual, and the ppl who don't have cso write your name on the sheet
why does this keep happening lmao
Idk lol
Tf
Nah I'm just genuinely saying, not trying to make people mad
I got 69 lol
🥰🙏👍
Only your row machine?
Cuz ours showed CS1.201
They took it back and are redoing the thingy
The attendance guy put Monday's code instead of Tuesday's code. He should correct it and resume attendance.
Ok he fixed it give attendance as usual
no u maddo
he’s redoing the entire biometric attendance?
Possible lmao
maddo is a new one
i think so yes
Lmao , tomorrow is Wednesday.

I think Ansh Chalbani
Could be mistaken though
OH THABK U 4/1/25, 10:26 AM - Shoaib: Valid crashout
this is crazy good
Thank you these retards don't understand one thing man again and again same shit
Respected Prof,  I completely agree with the points raised above. Our grades being dependent on others, especially randomly allocated teams can be affected very badly due to this. I request you to please reconsider this structure of conducting hackathon in teams and rather convert it into an individual hackathon. If that is not possible, reconsidering the teams should be done.
Anyone has any issues with this reply I'm posting? 4/1/25, 10:33 AM - Shoaib: The worst set of TAs one could possibly get
Posting then
you can make a moodle post yourself bruh 4/1/25, 11:16 AM - Hemang: Hi did no one get my mail🥲 4/1/25, 11:16 AM - Hemang: I replied to sanyam's mail
nop
Pretty sure you're supposed to go to Moodle and reply
Not reply to the mail itself
Replying to mails does not work as intended 4/1/25, 11:18 AM - Hemang: Oh crazy, can someone else post it if possible 4/1/25, 11:18 AM - Hemang: I'll send my text here 4/1/25, 11:19 AM - Hemang: ``` Respected Professor and TAs,  I hope you’re doing well. I understand the idea of balancing teams, but the goal of the hackathon is to let us showcase our skills and collaborate effectively. It feels a bit restrictive if we can’t work with even one familiar face, especially when we were asked for preferences.  It would mean a lot if we could be paired with at least one of our preferred teammates. As Sanyam suggested, an individual option could also be considered. If a complete reshuffle isn’t feasible, maybe a new form with more than two preferences could be circulated. That way, the allocation algorithm could be run again to ensure everyone gets at least one preferred teammate.  Working with people we know could make the experience more enjoyable and productive, even if we don’t win. Since the hackathon is worth 40% of our grade, we’re just hoping for a fair chance to do our best.  We genuinely appreciate the effort you put into organizing this, and we’re just looking for a way to make it a bit smoother for everyone.  Best regards, ```
Nice message 4/1/25, 11:22 AM - Hemang: You can quote me on this if u don't want to post it yourself, I don't mind. It's way too much of a hassle to write a post from moodle
Use Moodle app 😭 4/1/25, 11:22 AM - Hemang: There's an app!?
Needs vpn but is quite good
Good morning
Hey everyone! Don't forget to download the new My IIIT app from the Play Store. It has Assignment deadlines, attendance, *your* time table, leave application portal, e-ID Card (it can be used for unofficial purposes like at main gate etc.) and the whole mess portal integrated into it. The web admins have done a really good job and the UI is extremely good to use.  It works without Intranet, i.e., no more VPN hassle to do small changes in mess registrations, check deadlines etc. 4/1/25, 11:24 AM - Hemang: Isn't this different
Moodle app and my IIIT are different apps
Oh mb 4/1/25, 11:24 AM - Hemang: This is basically ims
Chee
Moodle requires VPN, my IIIT doesn't. My IIIT just has assign deadlines, nothing else
Good looking IMS
+ Mess Portal
+ Events list from CC website
+ ID card
Which is apparently not accepted anywhere 💀💀
we have our own app >:(
only needs vpn for updates, you can access previously loaded content without vpn
Don't mind it but my IIIT better
Once registered for meals
Hell no
I mean the app doesn't work sometimes because I have skill issues
👎
And it works without VPN
It is a pile of slop, but it is MY pile of slop 🥰
Imagine your only selling point being mooching off of others
I am not a part of any of these prohects
Projects
And we are talking about frontend
cough huge security risk cough cough
I'd rather open the sexy mess portal for mess shit than some random ahh app
Mess Portal backend is too good and these people dedicated do much time in that
My IIIT just integrated it but they did it quite nicely
++mess portal is the best shit on this planet top 1 worldwide website
Agreed, quite nicely integrated with hardware
VPN 4/1/25, 11:32 AM - Hemang: Even for detecting that it exists? 😭
Yes
Wait so is there attendance policy for ISS or not
pls ask the prof point blank in tomorrow's class
@section a
will there be a grade drop for more than 2 absences
Ill ask
thanku
and tell him that it is not the acads office that decides it, the final decision is with the prof
so please tell us what your decision is
Gotchy
Gotchu*
and if he still says no its acads office decision tell me I'll talk to him
Ok 4/1/25, 11:39 AM - Manan: Does anyone know who the head TA for LA is? 4/1/25, 11:40 AM - Hemang: Arnab afaik 4/1/25, 11:40 AM - Manan: Is he on the WhatsApp group 4/1/25, 11:45 AM - Hemang: Probably 4/1/25, 11:46 AM - Hemang: I don't see him but he should be there
He's not in the group I think
Just ask Sai Anirudh to remove attendance if he says yes
He will do that
Most probably*
@917497808993 ask sir about quiz 2 portion from textbook
💀
Will ask him to send on Moodle after class 4/1/25, 11:52 AM - Hemang: Blud no one pointed out it's 20%💀
ask about calculator too please
I was about to do so but then I didn't remember correctly at that point 4/1/25, 11:55 AM - Hemang: i just recalled it as 40, my bad
No one cares that much
He will post the same
And calculators aren't allowed
what in the actual fuck 4/1/25, 1:37 PM - Hemang: Wow 4/1/25, 1:37 PM - Hemang: Also, shubhan wtf
post this on moodle 4/1/25, 1:38 PM - Hemang: Fr
don't even have to check, its so obvious
ikr
Ikr 4/1/25, 1:39 PM - Krrish Gupta: lol freedom of speech toh honi chahiye, otherwise what’s the difference between us and Shiv Sena 💀
LA , the whole paper is only calculation based.  Without calculators gone 😭
atleast put some effort into trying to keep the teammates that'll do the work for you anyway 4/1/25, 1:39 PM - Hemang: Aren't u paired with sushil
How can you blame him, th course itself is intro to prompt engineering. 4/1/25, 1:39 PM - Krrish Gupta: Bro idc if they change teammates
SHIV SENA MENTIONED RAAAAH WHAT EVEN IS UNITY
How much skill issue do u have if u need to gpt a letter
so obvious tho
The intent is human . Only refined by chat gpt for more professional English and better words ig
Ok bro
Ok bro
grifter
See if we start GPTing even the most creative and mundane of our tasks we become fucking slaves to AI
Exactly
then don't?
Creativity where?
I saw a tweet yesterday where some guy was using ChatGPT to write a love letter for his girlfriend 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
And like writing a message isn't that hard
Bruh
creative and ai are oxymorons 4/1/25, 1:42 PM - Krrish Gupta: 😭
If a guy wrote me an AI generated love letter im BURNING his house down
Coz a guy wrote it to you or coz it's ai generated ?
2nd one
Idgaf about gendah
look yall dont have to use AI if u don't want to, just grow up and don't yapp about others using tools
Takes away a LOT of credibility from what youre trying to say if you cant even express it without an AI icl
Dear Shuban,  While the points raised by you are correct, you should take care of the fact that a course should not be compared with a professional job environment. In a professional job environment, all the working professional in that company are chosen after an interview process to check for skills required for working in the company. So, if you are randomly allocated a team, there are quite less chances of being paired up with someone who doesn't have any idea about the project. On the other hand, in our course, where most of us are aware of the fact that quite a few people are blindly using Generative AI and 'vibe coding' as stated by you are unaware of the topics altogether.
Wrote this to send on Moodle but didn't want to spam anymore
Can I post this
fair, but I think only people who have knowledge about the topics, can vibecode
Individual hackathon is the best thing that should be done
Spam
Nothing wrong in vibes coding.  People who use AI to code will be as good or even better than the guys who code on their own without any AI .  Finally only how much work gets done. How good is the final product matters. Doesn't matter if you use AI or not
Sure, just add that individual hackathon is an alternative if you want to
You will soon get to know
sure...
Sure....
AI will only take you so far man
you come in to the real world, you'll realise none of the good jobs can be done by ai
which is why ppl get paid money to do that work
your comparisons with the job environment are bullshit
sanyam has articulated that well
sanyam best
Agreed
Most of the time I use AI, I have to scrap the code to do it efficiently
and tell me, if you're saying the thing to be learnt is collaboration and communication, why are you outsourcing even that to ai?
vedant appreciating sanyam is rare
damn
Or use the code as reference at max
Real
It can be done with AI assist for now and that would be better than doing everything manually.  Also by the time we graduate, probably AI coding tools would be good enough to do most stuff.
Kyon jhagda karwa rahe ho
naman doing mp work is rarer
sorry saar😭
@917022285327 we should have competed what we started yesterday 🔪
Literally false. Try doing anything intermediate with an LLM and you'll spend more time debugging than solving problems
LLMs are glorified autocomplete, that's all
exactly
Actually
They have no mind of their own
LLMs cant even do a DSA aasignment properly
They have no ability to verify anything they say
Ummm
Easier to gaslight than a depressed fourteen year old girl
so that people can better understand my perspective. no one has time to read yappery :)
💀💀💀💀💀💀
But yea
so then what are you even doing in college lmao
send an ai agent in your place
studies also ai, communication also ai
we should have
I wrote the entire announcement post by myself. I would like the minimal amount of respect that if you're going to counter my point, please put in some effort of your own
No, I think that is if you do not want to work with your teammates, or they aren't able to do it well enough on their own
About the usage of AI
Guys, there is nothing to be gained by squabbling amongst yourselves
but muh dopamine
downfall of every leftist
ikr
Like i agree that ai is a useful tool, but that also means it cannot serve as a replacement. When you're having a conversation like this, person to person and esoecially when I myself and others have tsken the effort to writ our things ourself, it's basic decency to not ctrl c ctrl v ai written stuff
Because you used ai, you fantastically failed to bring your point across bevause everybody's talking abt smthg else now
💀💀💀💀
lmao imagine us 4 years later when ppl start marrying AI bots 🤡
Can you guys please discuss your mails which might affect all of us @917679041770
People take it lite for now
It's already sent
Yeah , atleast post stuff here before posting it directly on outlook
Like you talked about team work and stuff but didn't show half the decency to discuss it properly among your batchmates before doing something which is obviously not in teamspirit
Maybe phrase that better
That one guy who married Hatsune Miku be like
ecx detected opinion rejected
I want to be honest: the email wasn’t directed at all of you, even though I addressed it to "students."  I wrote it as I believe it’s important for the TAs and professors to recognize that there are diverse opinions out there, which is often overlooked in email discussions.  Your viewpoints are just as valid as mine, and I ask for that to be respected.  Regarding my use of AI in writing, I didn’t intend to offend @917075970819  or any other contributors in the email thread. However, I firmly support the use of AI for concise communication and vibe coding. It’s worth noting that effective vibe coding requires a solid understanding of the topic, and it can ultimately enhance development speed. But again, that’s just my perspective and idgaf  regards, some LLM (prompted by Shuban Biswas)
(me)
Peak
Brother you points are quite valid but you do realize that if we all started to spam our  opinions on the moodle thread it would lead to rejection of all of them
How to get Moodle access for ISS?
We can discuss all ideas among ourselves and then pass it on through the mail
It won't lead to loss of expression
Opinion rejected
Can anyone join iss whatsapp tho
please shut the fuck up
No 😔
don't call it vibe coding pls
Tell me one thing. What are the chances, sai does what we ask him to do?
There was a poll, an entire 3 hour discussion, and then the next day a moodle post was sent officially.. if u have opinions Noone is telling u to stfu but learn to respect the opinion of the 90% majority and not fucking that up by making look like all these vibe coding bs is supported by many
Close to ~0 but we still have the rights to put our points across
less than 0.1% 🤡 but that doesnt mean we shouldnt voice our concerns
Me enjoying the drama
Besides having multiple assignment 😭
do cis
Ed assignment first
Ed fun only no
Assignments will come and go, but debates will this comes once a yr
Did they not grant an extension for that?
saarrr I have LA absent on 19th March Wednesday, will that be fixed or grade drop? 💀
No

No need
Timepass
Shubhan used ai to beef with the majority view 👍
We put a thread to reconsider iss teammate building on moodle, and ppl are requesting that anyone making an addition to the thread send it here first
CND has still not gotten an extension for ED apparently
Lite  The prof doesn't know the answer to one of the questions either He was just like
Write
Get full
Lmao
how about avoid whatsapp and use pigeons 😂
The same AI when it develops more, can help in acceleration of finding new energy sources and making us more energy efficient.
although yea, carbon emissions are a lot, but idk
Ima be real (pessimistic) our planet is fucked anyways nothing we do matters when some rich billionaire faces no repercussions for causing half of our carbon emissions (fuck the ai usage in this particular scenario tho)
nvm it might actually be real wrf
Will AI ever reach the same level of "intelligence" as a homo sapien?
homo mentioned
this is so real tho
you turning off the lights during a goon sesh will not matter when Jeff bezos goes from the bay area to Austin on his penis rocket
Respected Shuban, I’d like to respectfully counterargue. Firstly, I’d like to clarify that the current team allocation is not random. It is a deliberate, score-based system that pairs higher-scoring students with lower-scoring ones to maintain average team balance. This isn’t about simulating real-world randomness, it’s about enforcing a narrowly defined version of fairness, based on mid-sem and Quiz 1 marks. While it’s true that the real world often demands adaptability, hackathons are not just about simulating workplace dynamics. They are short bursts of innovation, where prior rapport can make a real difference. There’s a difference between being randomly assigned in a corporate setting with weeks or months to adapt, versus a time-bound creative sprint where synergy and mutual understanding make a tangible difference. Your earlier point about using generative AI (such as LLMs) actually reinforces this. If such tools help bridge technical skill gaps, then the real differentiator becomes team synergy, not scores. That makes mutual compatibility even more essential than score balancing. Additionally, forming mutually preferred, consensual teams is itself an interpersonal skill. It involves communication, initiative, and collaboration, giving an opportunity to grow interpersonally. For those without close-knit circles, the preference process can help build new networks through informed, voluntary collaboration, something far more organic and constructive than forced pairing. Sincerely,

Hi everyone,    Room allocations are done, and the details have been sent to your college email IDs.  However, there was an issue with the script handling the process. About 5-6 people who received their last preference might not have gotten the email. If you didn't receive one, consider your last preference as your allocated room.  The entire process was automated with no manual intervention. Thanks for your understanding!
fuck I didn't get a mail
me neither
Same
ah thankgod
Idt anyone got the mail
ah then lite
Room/roommate swap form will be released soon
what about the mail sir?
Parijaat isn't done yet btw 🙏
I've been too busy 🙏🙏
How it feels like to be in that 5-6 people 🤔
💀💀 4/1/25, 10:19 PM - Amay 210: the mail I got only mentions the wing but doesn't mention room number
Only wings are allotted 4/1/25, 10:20 PM - Amay 210: ah okay
Yay!!
No mail received yet for me about room its joever
Why do i feel this is April fool🤨
Wallahi we r finished

i didn't get any mail either
Itne to log hi nahi the
no mail here
sanyam said 5 -6 people and I know 15 people who didn't get so idk what is going on
Only 5-6 mails weren't sent
Let me recheck
all 3 of my roommates got the mail lol
POLL: Did you get room allocation email ? OPTION: Yes (20 votes) OPTION: No (43 votes) OPTION: My roommate got (2 votes) 
5*3 = 15, math is mathing
5 - 6 people😭
not rooms
POLL: Recieved mail? OPTION: Received? (15 votes) OPTION: Not received? (8 votes) OPTION: Pretty sure that it's a fool's day prank (42 votes) 
Aa jayega
I think he meant 5-6 %
dam
alr
@917497808993 which is it
I think the script didn't work properly 😭
scam
if this is an April fools prank..... @917497808993
It shows mails are sent but they aren't 4/1/25, 10:27 PM - Amay 210: Yup
sounds like phishing email scam
skill issue + big L + ratio
Me when parijaat allocation isn't done yet
all mails sent or they are currently sending?
It's sent as per the script
I doubt if most of us got it though
as a punishment for this guys actions, reassign him 3rd floor please /c @917745090290 @917497808993

Bruvver I filled 3rd floor as my first preference
Not yet
well there is our answer then lmaooo
I thought I was also among those 5-6 people

Professional Family group
And now a family dispute has occurred
must be handled professionally though
anyone else who had submitted the form and got randomly allocated?
please dm me
otherwise please find a person to swap with
Well I'm actually curious, what was the issue with their concern about dinner, on Sunday?
their concern was fine, the way they kept annoying the committee was not
Something something the menu wasn't accurate/released late
the menu wasn't released on time, and then they were demanding some items be added
so the coord apologised for releasing it late
No I mean they actually got angry only after Amey sir's message
yea
Haan so what had happened before that, because his message sounded a bit aggressive
no that was the starting point ig
also apparently those two and another person are very hated anyways
lmao
sed life
i just realized who she is
aishani girl
she moved my stuff from my table at the workspace to a table just beside mine without like telling me and sat at my place saying you cannot leave your stuff.. I had gone to fucking lunch... and she's like there were no empty tables.. idk how she managed to find one to shift my stuff to.. then i shifted her stuff back and shes like you cannot do that i was sitting here.💀💀 mad shit happens
Oh
The tea is on fire 🔥🔥
The double standard is crazy
Quiz lite this is what I'm gonna do now
Okay I think that is enough context 💀  Imo they were not at fault on Sunday when the argument started, but there might be some old grudges here or there.. quite believable
Time well spent I'd say
oh yeah then my friends there were like how did you find another table and why did you touch my stuff without my perms and she said "there is fan here" 😂😂
Man that must be so frustrating there are certain seats in the ws that unofficially belong to certain people
i know where you live🥰
And I know where you live
lets meet 🥺🫶
You could prolly take a photo of me from where you're sitting
im at my room lmao coming there rn
Wtf
How could you do this
i needed something 😔
So your shit is still here?
half of it
🙂
lets continue in dms don't want the yuktahar thing happening here do we
It's a spam group, so we won't do that here
Really?
Unless things start crossing limits.
Define limits
"The message is self-sufficient in itself. Feel free to mention your assumptions in case you are assuming something."
I didn't bother to open an assignment and copy the actual line
Uh huh
Did u not now
And then it's upto us to judge if your assumptions are correct.
So you're saying you're superior?
He is tho?
Yes
Than all black boy? Sounds racist
You didn't get the ISS reference 😞
Nuh uh
I did and that was the goddam-
Bye
Omg seacc ji how could ypu
Seac hates black people confirmed???
Yeah, if you put an extra I you get ISIS
Explains alot of things
and the tas speak german

No wonder seacc ji was crushing our hopes by saying that quiz 2 is cancelled
He's as sadistic as them 4/2/25, 11:23 PM - Pratish 228: Can someone send DSA notes pls? 4/2/25, 11:23 PM - Pratish 228: Github not opening 4/2/25, 11:24 PM - Pratish 228: Thanks bri!!!

Gib credits :<
Friday 4pm
Thank you
Mb :( I'd assume that everyone already knows that these are your notes
ur notes are the best notes known to mankind
Lmao twas a joke dw
correction: on page 45 (in the rewriting handshake lemma part) it would be Sum of degree of all vertices = 2 x No of edges
Eys sorry it is in fact this
The theorem in the box is correctly written tho
whats the final verdict? are directed graphs coming?
pdh le, lite h
ok saar
from what page does gajjar's note start?
in these notes
@917976344711
Just start from wherever graphs start (which should be around page 40 iirc)
okii
you sending it makes it even funnier
Any source to practise dsa questions
?
prev year papers (2018)
There's nothing there tho
What is the mail of the sculpture sir
shajil@iiit.ac.in
Tree edges as in?
like the edges that you would actually be moving through while traversing, i.e, say you are going from u to v through an edge and v is not visited, you would traverse through this edge to visit v, then it is a tree edge
then tree edges will only be forward edges na?
because the nodes connected by backward and cross ones will already have been visited
yeah, he seems to have renamed tree edges to forward edges lol. but actually forward edges seem to be a different thing
oohkay i do not know this stuff so i only know the definitions from class
assume forward to be tree for the exam then ig
yeah
What exactly is forward edges? I’m confused now can someone pls explain it w a small example
Is it just a normal edge from parent to child and from parent to some other node with some intermediate nodes between them, or is that back edge
:,)
this edge is traversed during dfs/bfs
ChatGPT says that’s the tree node, and forward is where in u,v:v is descendant of u, but v was already discovered before u finishes and that it only appears in directed graphs. Is it accurate
yea thats what hari aakash was saying i think - forward has a different meaning usually but the prof has taught us the definition of tree edge in place of forward edge, so ig for exams we'll be assuming that only
no cso today right?
Wait what
For section B, we don't have CSO today
Its been rescheduled to tomorrow evening
We received a mail
What the fuck I would've preferred it be now man

Does anyone have umbrella in ws
That I can borrow for about half an hour
Speaking of umbrellas
I'm pretty sure someone just stole mine
I left it out in the lobby for it to dry
Later my friend asks me if he can borrow my umbrella so I go down to show him where it is and its gone
And he says he's pretty sure he just saw someone take my umbrella
A bakul guard once said to me : during monsoon, if its gone its gone
What the fuck man
I left it downstair once coz I had too many things in my hand and this happens
Should I put out a message on spam or sumtin?
Or is there any other group for this purpose
Does this apply everywhere in the college? Cuz someone once took my umbrella and then when I put on lost and found, it returned to where it vanished from the next day
Get the most quirky umbrella you can ever find, lets see if that gets stolen
solid color umbrellas might be stolen and if not, definitely are confused with others
lmao
Ig I'll try lost and found
There was only one lavender umbrella there, there was no other umbrella even close to tht colour
then its stolen
or some person's lavender umbrella might've been stolen and they assumed its theirs
Oh nvm it's back
lets og
go
Yippe
I'm never leaving my shit out in the open should've learnt my lesson when I had my handsoapstolen in the first week of college
Atp, I think ppl just grab a random umbrella and go and come back and put it back
10/10 reference
9/11 reference
says the guy who sleeps in ws
What does that have to do with anything (also I sleep in ws only during exam season)
if we ignore the bombardment of 1 star reviews
minecraft pretty good
maybe*
There are no one star reviews in ba sing se
People yall should defo watch this movie its peak (source: trust)
what in the ho ho Ahh Chinese wong ching bong dang is ba sing se
are tomorrow's classes cancelled?
I don't think so
if they were then we would have received email from academic office or the professor.
😔
thanks

26
uncultured swine 4/3/25, 10:53 PM - Ayush: Is there a reason the vending machines have been dry as hell recently
especially the obh one
apparently theyll be back by sat-sun
I can think of 2 reasons : 1) Due to multiple holidays they are facing difficulty in restocking the machines 2) There is a technical glitch that has been detrimental to the operations of the vending machines.
source: mp swati 4/3/25, 10:58 PM - Ayush: Fair 4/3/25, 10:59 PM - Ayush: Fair
my source was sanyam sar 🙏

Indranil made the sec-A class locked from outside  So that people can't go out after class
What. No i just saw ppl go out
What if he's planning to gas yall and he's making sure that yall can't escape
section a misinformation is crazy
Gate was locked she knocked 2 3 times  Then he opened
Ohh

pot calling the kettle black
"After thinking about it long and hard, I have decided to not give myself any extra work and yall have to deal with this"
this is just him saying wait for all the details to come, after which i will tell you to go fuck yourself ;_;
ikr

new
dhyaan de tatva 😞
Where is ur copis

People study LA
Actually don't, average mat badhao
Fr
Thanks for the useful info veena 4/4/25, 12:12 PM - Poonam: Please inform if indranil locked 😭
wide open but he will cross-examine you 4/4/25, 12:14 PM - Poonam: why does this sound invasive
What does the cross examination comprise of
One attendance will be deducted if u dont bring copis
Checking kopies
Wdym deducted
How's that even allowed what
a -= 1 4/4/25, 12:15 PM - Poonam: what the hell 4/4/25, 12:15 PM - Poonam: If I walk in he's gonna check my notebook?
He's asking rno na
Just give random ahh rno
kopij
Coupies
Gopi
Attendance cut if no gopi
Gimme ur roll no 😨
a-- better
rust does not have this nonsense
Skill issues
Exactly
I will modify the compiler code to have this functionality
Increment and decrement operators are goated
cniles when x++ + ++x
has attendance started in sec b la?
NONO
it will start around 12:45
[LOST] LA marks, last seen: never
Put in lost and found🥲
Lmao this is an issue in C++ too wtf
In 2025
C++ + ++C
is attendance still there for secA?
still no..
a = b = a - (true)
Last time he came at 12:58🙂
Which language does this work in
insanity
C and js require b to be declared
Python needs the walrus operator
Go too
Take some rest
No attendance?
How tough is it to code the backend in C for the ISS hackathon?
you were in my team for megathon
you won't be allowed to
??
Who said?
It's compulsory to use fast api ig
I don't think so
It is
Again, who told you?
Bet
If it isn't, I'll do it in rust
Yes
Fuck soham over
I'll stick to node/go
Node preferably
chicken
Do it in pure c
If they are ready to extend the time frame to complete it, 100%
You don't need time you need determination
Recite the Unix philosophy 2 times a day and you'll have enough power
idts
this post should get a maximum of a++ + --a votes
Did not know that undefined behaviour is a number

@917497808993 Amul feedback form please
Pls resend la notes pdf
It's urgent
Thank you so much
me when I finally get notes 39 mins before exam (still ain't gonna open it)
https://forms.office.com/r/2ihv2aU0S7
Wtf was that paper
Like actually
45 mins
Me when the paper only matters on calculation speed and not if I know concepts or not
Bruh I've choked so hard
When is the cso class for sec B
Fuck it exam over
I don't have to deal with this shitty subject till endsems
Ehhhh i needed more time 😔
Hopefully partial marking is there
Everyone needed more time 😭
i miss siddhartha so much 😭😭
I didn't write an 8 mark q completely i think I've lost more than pther ppl 😭
(I mean I'm doing shit under both profs soo)
I wrote bits of the 8 mark qs youd have to be insane to complete both of them
ikr 😭😭😭😭😭
tf was this paper
is he testing which one of us are robotic calculators
I was so happy to see three questions, then I saw the marking scheme
People, stop ranting now. Study ISS
Agreed
which one?
i didnt check the marking
shutup
as a proud leftist the only thing I know is ranting
Who asked
I did the same i hopw they have partial marking 😔
Brother the only subject i have any hope of doing well in is LA let me rant 😭
10
10*
Lol
10 only na
btw what was midsem weightage?
LA
20
Doesn't matter to him, kassi afterall
Real
You're one to talk
I really hope this doesn't repeat during the endsem
If we're expected to do 3hrs of robotic calculations which have no real bearing to the subject apart from direct formula implementation   What is the point
is 4.3.4 of cso textbook coming?
Or hope that it repeats with a non lengthy paper
Someone please ask him what is his intentions behind keeping a paper like this and not allowing calculators
So that at least he can look back and reason before setting endsem paper
I don't think having calculators will help either
this paper was just completely retarded
Do we write a moodle post/mail indranil/talk to some TA about it?
ike
ikr
he knew damn well that it would be calculation heavy, he literally said "buckle up" iirc
wtf when
I mean we can't do anything for this paper, so lite. But can atleast try to get a better endsem paper
is he just intentionally sadistic 😭
in class during QR factorization T-T
Tek out ur copis
aah i was absent :(
Yes, I don't want endsem to be like this.  I am getting horrified cause of that
and it was the same for snrs, idt thats gonna help
yea this is probably revenge for all the ppl walking out of his class 😂🫠
Hari sar has a problem with the paper?!🫨🫨🫨
How is that even possible I thought it was my skill issue
paper was literally just performing algorithms on a computer lmao
nah, paper skill issue
*on a paper
I wish we could perform it on a computer
++ but it was a copy paste of last year's quiz2 paper
oh yes, was changing without a computer -> on a paper and didn't complete changing it lol
That's our job as CND students
wtf 😭 this is sad
they had the same shit. One qr, one eigen and 2-3 npc questions😭
Still I couldn't do qr one 😔
I couldn't do the eigen one💀
Those retards it should have been for an hour
People, study CSO and ISS. There's no benefit ranting
aree

the geezers before us made the home page a permanent redirect to that page 😭
ikr ;_;

How much in detail did we do Classes and Objects?

No way in hell I'm gonna study all the shiz we did in labs and class
Just don't screenshot the repo on Moodle, screenshot the website 4/4/25, 7:54 PM - Hemang: I mean it's up on his website right?
Isn’t he’s gonna say we have a problem with everything ??
Duh
I'm pretty sure the Moodle threads are why he reconsidered it 😭😭
Nay but will he be willing to change stuff again and again is my main concern
I mean he does stupid shit for every single thing what does he expect😭😭😭
final exam is a 3 hour written coding paper in only binary
oi delete
Joshu gotta pull up with the deleted saw the Message u jesused

pjn lite
YES
YES PLEASE
Didn't you shout that this is the easiest paper you've written
Can I kill myself in front of Sai so that I alter his life course forever (plz tell me someone gets the reference)
Was this created by karre or TA's
THAT WAS SARCASM 😭
oh
hell yeah
Fuck this shit exams are over who cares abt this shitty ahh 2 cred course
man after you shouted that, and after I saw messages in the iss group at 4 30 I got so scared brun
You can ask dean to scream at sai

guys girish is here
Don't take it literally but please go there to raise your concerns. We promise we will follow up on all of them for sure (please DM us in case we forget). Feel free to express any changes you like to be in courses, grading patterns, credits etc.
Can't say it there but please ask about an option between DSA/ISS 5 creds
pls come to roast him
lmao
I can't attend the meet, so leaving it up to you guys
No please, if ISS paper is coming like this.  Then no point of anything in   ISS
dean is here too
if u want iss to change come and yell at him
"Option"
if i end up asking all the questions they'll think im some clown 💀
Dude we just got out of a traumatic exam ask the ecx guys to go or sumtin
Oh okay
thanks mathily good to know
wow so cute
Damn already dressed up for placement (at the homeless shelter)
guys tapan sau is threatening us to call y'all
AWWWW GRIISH
I think becoming an iss ta is the way to become a psychopath
"sir fuck you and your entire family"
Ok
thenk u
Gonna tell him rn ms. Nandini Chakravarty said this
say that to yourself also if u saying it anyways I don't like people of your kind
crazy how you know my surname
Btw all questions today were directly picked up from your lab activities.
clown emoji to this please 😭😭
ppls
please show up
istg if half of h105 is not filled i will stop raising all your issues
this is literally a forum for you to raise your issues
tf are you guys doing
I've been to everyone of those so far
Imo it feels like a waste of time
then me raising your issues is a waste of my time
No cause in the FSIS nothing really happens
Also no offence that's kind of the role of an MP
We find you guys to be better to approach and more productive
Than these meetings
Plus I haven't slept in so long
this happens once a year 😭
That's because batch MPs don't follow up
No, literally UG2 and UG4 MPs don't do anything
And their FSIS turnout is too bad
Except 2-3*
Guys there is attendance
Come
@UG1-MPs thanks for raising our questions in FSIS today, I ain't leaving OBH after ISiS trauma, we love yall tho 🫶
I would like to git revert a statement I made 30 seconds ago
omw
Stop leaking answers when I left that entire page blank
I lowkey feel that the placement of this meeting was deliberate like cmon why have it right during exams
Tbf it's right after
but...
Like do you want us to come or?
during*
wait but what attandance
Consider ECX arent done yet with theirs
Ok yeah I didn't leave it blank it had my roll no (yes I am shamelessly reusing the same joke)
I too wrote your roll number
Yes ecx students yallshould rage too
You know who else wrote my roll no?
IM SO THANKFUL I CAME TO THIS FSIS
SO SO HAPPY
OMFG MY LIFE IS COMPLETE
peak kamedi
bro literally said "it is what it is"

Can't help but notice that the profs who actually teach us aren't here
bring sai Anirudh Karre here pla
Pls
Is vpn down
Need Indranil, need to talk about bad papers
Idk how to talk about it without him there
Wait are they actually talking about the fucking cursed wing 💀
What the actual fuck is this guy yapping I already regret coming here
I mean whatever is going on here is more hilarious than productive
Now I really miss being there
Someone please record the meet
Excuse me
You hypocrites
Asking us to come so much then u guys don't show up 😔
I can't come due to Star Party
what about the other MPs
Naman and Neharika are also going
Poor vedant is sitting here between 3 faculty members
Guruji op 🔥🔥🔥
Lmao i shout at them anyways
based
Because we get to shout at them on a daily basis, you guys don't :)
The more you shout the less I have t9
we need inspiration
Idc yall should lead by example 😔
How are we supposed to go against the tyranny of the professors without the mps on our side
With you in spirit dw
Hi guys I wanna shout about iss, can y'all tell me what you hate about it
sai
Binary marking
Unless we're fighting saiyan saga vegeta and we need a spirit bomb to win idt that's gonna help us fight the profs
but also the fact that it’s way too much work for too little reward (2 credits??)
Classes are irrelevant to exams
Syntactical and pure rote and memory type questions in exams
Labs and classes are mismatched
section b is behind section a by 3 classes iirc?
Ye
Sai Anirudh Karre TAs
we do shit in class a week after we did it in lab
and (re: 85%) the classes are fucking useless
That's it?
“oh you just have to set your priorities”
wdym that's it 😭
Say it in fsis
added "not enough time to practice"
Last one for sure
not enough time, add labs are fuckall haywire
the labs are literally made to be gpt'ed cuz even the ta's know we cant do this in 3 hours
someone say “congratulations”
what wonderful non answers
Raise this point : Iss lab has become 1 hr lecture + 2 hr chatgpt
ikr 😭
ok im bringing up iss next
sai isn't here
doesn't matter
alt
Alr*
we go to dean 🔥
based
Can anyone be radical enough to imform them that they're making jokes of problems that are very imp for us? Inform them that it feels like they're not considering anything we say
I'll do
Based
Ok thanks
Do it the same way i would 🙏
Insult them subtly :)
new sports portal incoming
so their solution to limited infra is “let’s ratelimit it”, not “let’s build more” :D
Why can't you just do badminton or whatever at your own free time and get attendance for it
Why does it have to be at one time
It's not like the coaches teach anything
You just go there and play
We have coaches?
For namesake
I thought we just have a nagu
The fact that the academics person is answering this than the health person shows how much they care
I regret coming here
Literally 0 answers
Bro it's not that it's depressing when I'm forced to do sports and on top of that the sport you don't want to do 😭
Yeah I can see why none of the ug2 or ug4s care abt this
This entire thing is just a gucking joke
Kiya?
ALSO I MISSPOKE WHEN I SAID LESS PHYSICAL I WAS QUESTIONING THEIR DECISION NOT ANYTHING ELSE SORRY
NOT MY PERSONAL BELIEF
😭
Sadge
Just pick some random irrelevant part of the question and try to prove that wrong
idiots keep asking dumb questions
-_-
Unfortunate
1 day leave
Ey that's never going to happen unless exams 😭
WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN
started kiko cut scenes
WHAT ARE YOU DOJNG TO NOT FALL SICK
.
is Kavitha vermuri there?
health shit I mean
Bruh this is just false
can we just exodus at this point
Genuinely sorry for this not my personal belief at all
they very clearly don’t give a rat’s ass about us
P sure cnd had an exam canceled cause prof didn't show
this is true
Yeah :)
SOMEONE BRING THAT UP
PLEASE
YES
Actually that is such an ass move
wait let me talk
Then he goes sorry mixup happened
Mf
and I wanna bring up ISS too
These profs are wasting time on irrelevant things so that time runs out
They are not here for us
Like actually? Like "oopsie teehee my bad" wtaf
Yeah
Shut Greaseworm up 😭😭
Girish does not give a shit abt the food that we eat omfg
Someone please do this
We had classes cancelled in first sem with mails at 10:35
The class was at 10:30
We didn't mind much tho, the prof was chill
Finally
Wth is happening?
I am at home
Vedant saab
Lesgoo
Rajakrishnan ah
Yeah lmao
He mailed us at 3 in the morning on average
yeah I know lmaooooo
Alr keep me updated abt what they say 🫡
They are trying to take Vedant down
“unwell or had to travel”
the prof
fucking
forgot
Is this guy seriously comparing taking a normal leave to skipping a fucling quiz?
Fucking hypocrisy
and didn’t even bother telling anyone else
our ta
was
That's the general trend with every student faculty event, they just yapp on useless shit
@918078207252 , there is a prof in CGD, who just cant stop yapping about random shit completely separate from the actual topic, you know who right?
:D
(hint: head of LSI)
LFG AARNAV GOAT
(hint 2: he's here)
How much did he yapp today?
only yapped once, expected more 😔
#disappointed
Crazy, bro did not get a chance in front of the dean ig
lmao yeah
spill
never mind the feedback forms my guy you’ve got the feedback in front of you
Fumbled a bit oops
Tf u mean fumbled that was perfect
What did he say ?
Omg
OMG
what
Insane
Addressed most of these points
tell tell tell
😭
He hackathon
Remove
What
No
we spoke to the wrong guy 😭
Kiko removed the hackathon
Not Karre
who's kiko
this is just gonna reinforce the endsem thing
Dean acads, Kishore Kothapalli
oh f
Wallahi what the actual fuck
Why
so the dean is the imposter
why did I think sai was bad Ahh 💀
Hi shuban I see you
That's fair
Bs
i cannot write another paper like today in iss 😭
lets mail for ISS project
they’re all bad
Wattttt the fuckkkkkkkk
instead of hackathon per say
Yeah I'd prefer the hackathon as well but the fact that we got to skip the endsem was too good
HELP
😭😭😭😭😭😭
Convince him to bring it back smh
Okay so no endsem in iss that's what you're telling?
tell him we’re not opposed to a hackathon
wait what no endsem in iss? so today's quiz was the last paper?
No endsem? Yes that's what everyone wants
So ask for a hackathon
That's the entire fucking point
Vedant and aarnav pai carrying 🔥🔥
Someone nerf these guys they're too goated
no
naaah, let. them. cook
What will happen to us dude???
The best FSIS in the history of IIIT
You guys did it
Bruh it was a joke 😭
FSIS even exceeded the time allotted
That's not how it works 😔
Until I get the summary, the chat shows so
Yeah and the chat says that this meeting is a waste of time
Nooooo
why are they defending things like this?
Less work
Great gif
Yeah, I didn't want to concede to a ta so I mailed a prof, and I got flamed by him instead of my concerns being addressed
How do I even go beyond that
I can't beef with a fucking prof
@917745090290 add this in your FSIS notes Great way to summarise Shuban' s gif also shows our pov

For more details contact @918688380432 *MP*🔥🔥🔥
Thanks to his efforts for organizing this massive event while still being UG1
yeah bro they’re tone deaf
He did not just bring up th 15% attendance thing
we been complaining about lack of time and that 15% is too little but lite you can use 15% to go to shit you like and even watch the recordings
Girish verma is really asking for it
What a bastard
someone pls bring this up
Like do they realise that 15%  is like 4 days at best
Can we though? Or should we? @917745090290
And you can't skip fucking graded labs
Uhh what just happened
Ah this is the perfect moment to bring this up
copium
Yeah no they did not address anything
Does mr.kiko say *"I do not blame you"* at the start of every sentence??
Same energy as "I am not racist but..."
Yeah lmao very nice non answer 😭
Atleast 90 % I think
Istg. Literally every other college has it at 75
No @917745090290  Thank *you* for calling
what happened to the lab schedule swap for sec a/b?
can we make it happen pls
THATS WHAT I TOLD
nigga was like profs show up uwu
NIGGA YALL DONT HAVE 4000 class a day
Is fsis still going o
On?
😭🙏
Pls post on DSA grp
Was there ungraded lab for sec b this week?
it was combined iirc
I hope you all realise now how much we MPs go through while dealing with the institute to get every small thing done
And don't worry, we will follow up on the issues (that should be)
Tf
+++++++++
Lol (lots of love)
wtf
nop
Regarding the iss thingy did anything meaningful cameup with the faculty?
the tas said to get the entire batch to agree to an endsem with reduced weightage + project/hackathon
and tell sai
I'll talk to the tas
No endsem pls
not possible apparently, min weightage they can push to is 5%
But will try
Wouldn't that mean the quiz 2 weightage will go high
They said they can't do tht and the max they can do is reduce its weightage
No
It just means it'll get allocated towards the project
Quiz 2 weightage won't change guarantee
Things that are already done will not change
Petition to change quiz2 weightage to 2% 🥲
No
What project
Huh
Basically from 20% endsem it'll go to 15% project/hackathon and 5% endsem
Sounds logical enough
Essentially they want to keep project
Instead of a hackathon
Ou
Basically 2-3 weeks
i did it kinda non subtly 💀
You'll be in a team same style but
Don't know
Bruh what the hell was wrong with having a hackathon?
Couldn't they just reallot teams
Dean denied it supposedly
Why?
He just said "i don't blame you ......... VARIANCE...." then fell silent
Tf?
he said he didnt want an exam with a lot of variance
basically i think the tas got the idea of the skewed teams thing from him
Bruh
First of all, they sent a preference form
And on top of that they gave randomised teammates
And now that random teammates has led to us get an endsem
Why
ikik
And there's a mistake from our side too
Those perspectives counter perspectives counter to counter and all
Why to do all that
We could have discussed here
Instead of giving them the idea that UG1 is not united on that
Breaking news: Working class discovers culture war distracts from class war
It's like that one man with the funny beard said
we should have an fsis where we shout at the mps
Sure
we don't need an fsis for that
After endsems
shout at a local mp today
okk
Done
@917075970819
do you not do that on a daily basis
for the ones that work at least
like the real Delhi ones BTW these ones (some of them atleast) are cute leave them alone
vedant when have i ever screamed at u😔
https://youtu.be/yARrsQgR43s?si=UZaqBNaheBfLhFIN

Anyone who want the change in DSA lab please help me in debate
happy birthday @919677232382 :)
Debate mentioned uwu
Happy birthday @919677232382
fight fight fight
ppl why are you complaining about less graded labs??
the later ones are only going to get tougher
POLL: DSA Labs OPTION: 3/5 (118 votes) OPTION: 4/6 (4 votes) 
smone pin pls 4/6/25, 2:43 PM - ~ Pavaneswar NELAGONDA pinned a message
there's a clear majority
even if we give time, it's not gonna change much 4/6/25, 2:55 PM - Devansh 211: Yeah and clearly the lesser graded lab structure is much better for us
10 mins of poll WOW!! 4/6/25, 2:55 PM - Devansh 211: Ita anyway relative so whatever losses you think you are facing in absolute grades is something everyone will face
++
I am only raising concerns for so called "weak" students 4/6/25, 2:56 PM - Devansh 211: Yeah but around 15 percent of the complete batch has already spoken 4/6/25, 2:56 PM - Devansh 211: Yk that the latter topics are even going to be harder
and you think ki "weak" people will score 300/300 in graphs ??? 4/6/25, 2:57 PM - Devansh 211: So no actual help to for saying sake the "weaker students" also
If this puny majoritarian approach will hamper the lower half of the class "(below average)" 4/6/25, 2:58 PM - Devansh 211: Bro the below average part will be neither hampered nor helped
So reduce the no. Of chances the have in hand
what is bro spitting 😭 4/6/25, 2:58 PM - Devansh 211: How do you think having another one of the crazy tough graded lab helps a below average part of the class
If the majority changes, I'll tattoo the poll on myself 😁 4/6/25, 2:59 PM - Devansh 211: It's obviously if they reduce these chances they give more weightages to the chances you had
Bro just be realistic You know that the level of the labs will only increase 4/6/25, 2:59 PM - Devansh 211: Exactly
Topics are not same
guys vote 4/6 just so sricharan gets tatted
(let's do this)
🥰🔪 4/6/25, 3:02 PM - Devansh 211: Bro yk the ssp algoa are much tougher anyway and they have many variations of those so by general opinion it's going to be tougher
It's only to accommodate students and give them another chance
POLL: DSA LABS(SO THAT Sricharan GETS A TATOO) OPTION: 3/5 (15 votes) OPTION: 4/6 (38 votes) 
We should vote on what tattoo as well btw 4/6/25, 3:04 PM - Devansh 211: Also if you please let me tell you the math suppose you had 2 graded labs left meaning 8 percent in original scenario now you have 1 which is 5.3 percent then if you did a previous lab well as said by you I. The message so it also weights 1.3 percent more so now you have a very minute actual lapse that is just 1 percent or something 4/6/25, 3:04 PM - Devansh 211: +1
Quite bold of you to plot against your roomate
I just want you to get a cool tattoo 😔
just cancel all labs💯
yeah i stand with arya
Nah it's fine macha 😇😇
give all weightage to end sem
fr
60% endsem theory exam
all labs should be nulled lamo
Happening to us in GSC 😭😭
or give some of it to endsemlab exam
moss lagne ke nateeje
lab mei nahi laga
scene when gsc prof *also* fails to show up
what ra ek baar moss suna bas peeche pad gaya 😔
suna toh bahut kuch hai
mat suno
Gandhi idealogy
😂 fk
ik who ratted me out but whatever
wait did you get mossed just for telling on this group that there's a hidden line of instruction?
they removed the confessed lmao
Aha wow
I did, but now they just updated and removed it
idk if ill get marks or not
why would someone snitch what 😭
I feel bad for the amount of people who fell for that trap tho 😭
there's an imposter amogus
Wtf is a GPT moss anyways bruh that shit generates a different answer whenever it feels like it
ya, its soo sad. Who would even be soo inhumane to snitch about a post on the group
mfw when i get mossed for READING THE ASSIGNMENT 😨😨😨😨😨😨😨
it was the hidden instruction trap
basically there was a hidden instruction
if you copy pasted directly to and from gpt
That billion vaala?
are all GPT mosses in Q3 for that trap?
yes
you'd print -1 for billion
the snitch also showed my message to the TAs in person 💀💀
idts
tell us who it is no
Lmao no fucking way bruv
they mossed all the submissions for q3 mostly so even if a singular submisison shows 100000000 then they might have gotten mossed
they can’t moss you for that, you can literlaly complain to acad office ab this lmao
yes exactly you did nothing wrong
~I got GPT mossed and I didnt have the number in my code at all~
wait you know who snitched?!
wait did you submit a code with the 1 billion in it or not
lmfao but yeah theres no grounds for mossing you
id email the prof if I were you
imagine they flagged that one if condition
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Bro they might have flagged all submissions with 1000000
wait and let’s see what the moss is for
LMAO
don’t be stupid
yea they probably did lmao
just go to the evals
yeah just go to the evals and be like haha got you
i wanna see their reaction
fair
the tas will probably clear you if theres no other moss lol
POLL: mossed? OPTION: yes (14 votes) OPTION: no (47 votes) 
L imagine getting mossed
moss lite
Do they remove marks for that particular question or for the entire assignment??
Entire
Unless you confessed
Yeah that too
> gets 0
Does IoT midevals have any weightage ??
Yes
It has 35% of the total project weightage
We have soo less info about it, what should we present,  Should we just show our progress or shoud we show the full product or should we create a ppt and stuff and present it ?
Can someone send the moss list
Bro what is even the point of this poll you know exactly who got mossed
We're expcted to show our working prototype (whatever the fuck that entails)
wtf is this about?
when does vindhya printer shop open tomorrow?
9:30ish usually
I didn't find it open before 10 anyday
11 would be my safe guess Have often found it closed at 10
It's normally open at 10:15
Oh
Who tf did that ☹️
whaaaa 4/6/25, 8:58 PM - Ojas Kataria: My guy toying with fire
Yeah
Now you gotta go to egypt
I didn't get the stuff I can use to send program to espcam
🤡
oh yeah, I got MOSSed btw 😂🍿
Congrats!!
Birthday gift 🥳
"No sir,  gpt copied from me"
"You need to understand"
Happy birthday :)
Which question lmao
And why 😂
lmao
the tas just needed an excuse to wish you happy bday in person dw
P3 and GPT
damn 😂
This proves that moss software has a bug and that needs to be addressed immediately.
this is why you should not train gpt 😔
lmaoooo
As soon as they see you walk-in, they'll apologise for any confusion caused and escort you back
didn't train gpt 😔
you need to ask them which ai model they ran it against and if its grok you need to show them your bank balance lmaooo
gpt grok same thing
Do yoga ppl have class tomorrow evening??
do we have morning class?
Can we go to sports everyday this month
Nagu told me that if we want to attend beyond ur own slot   u can do only in the morning shift  not in the evening
why not
idr her saying we dont
Shit
God bless the best 4 of 5 assignments and i love how the tas can't even deign to give me a "no" if they're not going to extend :)
lmao 4/7/25, 12:01 AM - Pratish 228: I can still see an option to submit
Obv but it counts as a late submission 4/7/25, 12:01 AM - Pratish 228: how much re we penalised for that
Nah ain't no one topping this truly a moment for the history books
No clue
Ask a ta i suppose
I submitted wtv half of the assignment i wrote -_- 🤷‍♀
i submitted at 1159 and it showed me 43 seconds late lmao
Can we get like a 10 min buffer😭
Nah bruh wtf let's fight the tas if they don't give guruji his marks 4/7/25, 12:07 AM - Eashaan Thakur: I got luck then
Happened to me once, but the deadline got extended before I could take the ss Now I have it as precisely 15 mins early 4/7/25, 6:03 AM - Gautam 016: Is there yoga today?
Has cso attendance started?
nope
now?
No
Damn sankalp
Prof would be heartbroken if he found out what you were doing
Don't come 💀
Ok
Yeah the embarrassment is not worth it
Why, what's happening there?
The prof is now asking people why they attend class if they not gonna pay attention/come this late
He said if we don't have any interest he'll just ask the academic office to give us attendance
yeah, he is kinda posed
Posed
pissed*
handwriting issue
Skill issue
Bol do fir
If he's not good
Then acha alternative to hai
did attendance start now tho
Bruh who has the balls to go to a prof and shamelessly ask for free attendance saying they have no interest in their classes
Nop
He's good only tho
Wayy better than parachuri
Then why low attendance
830 class I'm guessing?
still didn't start the attendance??
Spill
Next time I'll wake up early for CSO secB class
lesson learned
Tf is going on there
He who shall not be named
Ah thanks for the explanation
He whoth doxxed me in DSA
Makes sense
Wait what 💀
NO WAY REALLY UH
No fkin way crazy
only 10? 4/7/25, 2:00 PM - Ojas Kataria: Kick
Can someone who has sports today pls confirm with Nagaraju whether we can go daily evening?
Or only morning allowed
only mornings
Till when will we have sports
endsem
Whosoever knows please inform
I don't think they will mind now..as sem is at the end
@917745090290 can u confirm
i have yoga not sports
so idk
please ask nagaraju directly
I never went in my slot from jan... Still, I got the attendance...
Ok noted, sending info to nigaraju
that would be great
except I have yoga and I might have yoga for the next 2 sems too, so attandance lite
Someone confirm with Nagaraju today na
Well, they didn't let tts people get their attendance today
Ohh shit
wdym? they never check
They do
They do manual na
yes but its never been an issue for me
I just put mine....no issue
didn't sai say he'll confirm regarding final exam by Monday 😔
you still expect things from sai?
We got the confirmation
yes(?)
not from sai 😔
i want sai to confirm
thats on you dawg
same
acad office goes above sai
if dean has said no then its a no
fuck kiko
Wallahi we r finished
sadly
bruh no, ISS written endsem would be so bad
why have you fuckers already given up
When did the Dean say no
FSIS
He did not say no
The TAs are on our side, they also want a project
true, make endsem worth 0.5%. ez
Quiz2 also pls
5% can be done I think
true
I know we fucked up but tbh  paper was not so difficult
I mean fair 😭
Shh let us cope
Yeah just getting 2 hrs to study for such a huge syllabus is unfair
That's also there, we had two exams and this one is plain wrote memorization, can't really prepare in advance for taht
When will this fascISSm end
when the leader shoots himself in a bunker
Please tell him to hurry up
When the I _SS_ falls
30th April 🥰🥰
I interpreted this as "when I, SS (Sai Sankalp) fall"
Sankalp defending profs until the very end
If only my name were Sai Sankalp lmao
What else would it be then
null
Mess mentioned 🔥🔥🔥
Same fucking thing
That's just your full name bruh 😭
It's not lmao, trust me I've nearly registered incorrectly for my boards, I should know
It's one word tho 🤷‍♂️
That just sounds like a skill issue
Doesn't
Matter
See, I believed my name was whatever you told until class 12 So yeah, skill issue it is
Bruh who gives a rats ass abt the legal shit we all call you sai (space) sankalp
And even if it's one word doesn't mean we can't abbreviate it
Valid counterpoint
Cutie got her meds ❤️
@919677232382 now doggo no bite
She beefing with the sign in the background

Someone send shaik babu to mll lab in kcis or his number asap

Why only exam for iss
Is amul open 4/7/25, 10:09 PM - Satvik Shrivastava: is vpn down for anyone else?
Anyone with cello tape in the workspace?
Anyone has a screwdriver/knows where to get one?
Or knows some hacky way to unscrew the ports on a relay?
@919344529774 didn't wanna mention this in the dsa grp but try implementing a better check for whether your tree can be coloured or not
Deepseek fixed it for me when I got this error
Ok yeah claude is telling me something similar thx for the help
Yeah, look into that and look for ways to fix that
@917745090290 stop 🌝 me and go fix your code
:<
i already check for this lol
My -1 thing works before I do the processing tho
Unless you're gonna just use the best 3 of 5 thingy 😔
Already used it
writing gsoc proposal lol
Hm
My god
Go
😔🙏
yup
The only q i can do has 50 proposals alr so yay :,)
Prolly more now lmao
aah url shortener?
Ye
there are probably more u can do
maybe take a look
Yes go
but its already last day lol
Get that 100 🙏
a lot of them need back and forth discussion before they get accepted
Gsoc proposal speedrun time
Lmao no i'll try next year
that would be better lol
Ok anyways @919344529774 hope your code works now
Yeah no it ain't working :(
Nooooo :((
give your code to deepseek deepthink, and ask what is wrong
What is the approach you are using?
First check if it is a linear graph (if it isn't output -1, works properly since that was the only thing I did in the lab and I got marks for it), check all 6 possible permutations, then print which ever gives the lowest (and also simultaneously checking for lexicographic order)
same
are you sure the lexicographic part is correct?
Well, when I kind of did the same approach, I got straight 100. But before that, I got 16 when I used a wrong approach that works only for 3 node trees. The cases that failed then are almost the same cases that you are failing right now. So I'm guessing your problem might lie with trees with >3 of vertices.
yea thats probably what's happening then :/
its fine i dont have the time to correct it lol
thanks anyways :) 4/7/25, 11:53 PM - Ojas Kataria: How are you checking if it's linear?
It’s not debugging after a point 😭😂
When creating it, if number of neighbours reaches 3 then it wont work and I print -1
incidence matrix whenever length of a subarray > 2
yea 4/7/25, 11:55 PM - Ojas Kataria: Hmm
YES THERE IS
CAUSE FRISBEE LEAGUE FORMS ARE OUT
GO CHECK OUTLOOK FILL FORM FAS FAS
What's a frisbee league
do we get attendancee
No leagues have attendance afaik lmao
:/
Okay lads and ladies whats the general agreement on ISS here
We need to do shit and we need to do it fast
We want a project and endsem, with reduced weightage for endsem right?
I _hope_ that is majority take?
I have no idea anymore
And I can't process half of this shit
I just want this subject to be over and done with
We will be free within less than a month
Holy fuck ur right
We don't talk abt that
We only talk abt the sexy 2.5 month holiday
@917075970819 same to you meanie
sure
between the two of us only one person messaged in the wrong group and it certainly wasn't me
how many leaves can we take without getting a grade drop?
in full courses and iss?
full courses 4
iss 2
(and other half courses 2)
We will all make comeback
someone text when dsa attendance starts
They closed it before 9?! (LA)
Yes please
Arre itna dukhi mat ho Nagaraju ko poochte hai ek baar aaj But if that's ur main goal rather than playing or trying out a new sport then I don't think you should register in the first place
I love sports🤓
No space for us 😭🙏
lmaoo
Oh damn this is the most crowded I've seen this room
Sir prolly thinks everyone is a die hard Dijkstra fan 4/8/25, 9:33 AM - Pratish 228: I hope he thinks that way
ok section a people respectfully fuck off after attendance and let sec b people have seays
I think yalls LA is gonna be terrible as well
I want attendance too FUCKKK he locked from outside😭
Section A people are gonna come attend LA and then no one's gonna have space to sit lmao
@ecx ppl who is aec head ta?

People, if you want to have a look at the menu of canteens, you can do that at iiitstalls.github.io We made a repo for internal book-keeping of prices but then I thought there's no harm in making a static website out of it.
Works offline as well*
There might be some mistakes that we will correct soon
when will chats come back ? 4/8/25, 11:45 AM - Pratish 228: Amul will be open today, right?

Jao bhai this isn't worth the trouble
Just sit in front of him 4/8/25, 12:00 PM - Shoaib: Deserved

Sh3 ppl, did anyone see a dark blue wildcraft bag at the last benches in the corner left  I left it here during the hour break and I can't find it now😭

Sec a go back!!
Fair
Guys
What if we also walk out
Lol. No way brother gonna do that
I don't think this solves anything 😭
🌝
Fuck that I need my attendance
We don't want them to go scrutinize timestamps now
*really dont
@sec a please come out if he’s gonna check the list we’re actually cooked 😭😭😭😭😭
Yea I’m gonna fail if that happens for sure
you are also secA na? 😭😭
It’s been 20 min since I came out
I don’t think they can see that
they can, the machine records it
They cann
😭😭😭😭😭😭
dw bro was over it as soon as yall left 😂
he's just yapping mathamatical shit
So I’m gonna come back 🥲
If there r seats lol
Goodluck about that 💀
What if the ta is gonna do smtng
I'd say atleast 20% of the class is still sec A 4/8/25, 12:17 PM - Ojas Kataria: He's here 4/8/25, 12:17 PM - Devansh 211: Oooh list is here !!
...
Crazy 4/8/25, 12:17 PM - Devansh 211: Now gone !
Tf
So are secA peeps getting kicked out or...?
Either to upload notes on Moodle or bang sec A ppl 💀
uh Ohh, bro prolly has some career ending data for Sec A peeps he showed sir
Thank god I’m out 😭😭
What list?
SecA peeps 4/8/25, 12:18 PM - Devansh 211: He said and brought sec b and something list and showed it to the prof
Oh wow
But nothing is happening so ig lite onli 4/8/25, 12:19 PM - Devansh 211: Yeah i think prof is over it
Riyal
Real ass move tho @secA
@mps what's gonna happen if they check the timestamps 💀
who knows whats happening in backend, maybe cancellation of cross attandances so far 🫡🗿
We're all fucked
Big time
Bro imma fail the course 💀
Enjoy
Nthng much it's just jrs and u are gonna be in the same class studying together next yr(if u have no attendances)
Dude how does indranil go to being so chill with latecomers to suddenly locking the door broo
Idt u can fail due to attendance
I mean grade drop
U can
If it's too low
🙃🙃
Na u get D U don't fail
Guys let’s not assume anything let’s be positive 🤡
Smh bro it's bad
What's funnier is that he locked it around 8:57 It was supposed to be 9 😐
Isn't it 2 grade drops then straight F?
Imagine calling a D bad whatta kassi
Yes
Na. Basically if u get a D. The college won't give u a grade drop
POLL: Should Sec A folks get cooked? OPTION: yes (15 votes) OPTION: no (17 votes) 
Arre don't laugh, people 😑
Play musical chairs and decide who gets to sit
Yes, so if you are expecting C and attendance between 65-75, better leave the course and only copy assignments. You will get the same grade
Dude it's not gonna be limited to just secA
Everyone is gonna be screwed
wow that's a big... drop...
Be a united batch lmao what is this parititon
Nah that's their skill issue
Exactly
but especially sec a
ok lets not do a section war
Sec B struggled with Lini
Why give up a chance for racism (classism)
if b happened to have indranil in the morning we’d do the same thing
Joshua you're my IoT partner We'll deal with this later... :)
'a' section war 😂
the question is how do we manage to not get royally screwed by acad office
What does that have to do with anything
cuz people from both secs have done cross/double attendance
war on 'a' sectoin
that's the neat part.... u dont
Nah I want beef section war ftw
can the sec a people (after receiving attendance) maybe go to indranil and apologise profusely
I did for cso
Do u believe ur gonna be immune to the aftermath
convince him not to tske this further
Yes?
Eh, lite I'm more worried about that fact that I have only 1 attendance to spare with 5 more classes remaining
This
Idt I've ever seen him in A
worst case he wont give yoj today’s attendance
Will  they screwup this too
yall will still be fine for dsa
🫡
Joshua be nice
Brother I have attended all my classes in sh2 your threats have no real value
I am at 4 absents, all subjects, since H1. I'm living on the edge
please guys i dont think anyone can afford to take this further
Ok papa
~Edgelord~
MFS CAN YALL TAKE THIS SHIT SERIOUSLY
nah, worst case is acads office go over all the previous attendences of all students
Hehe 'edge'
Fr
i mean worst case if they go apologise
idt hes itna petty also
ki after kids apologise and explain he’ll still be a jerk
Never underestimate iiit
im just saying
an apology wont hur
Is it a good idea to just approach him in next class, show him that we were there before 9 and just apologise and ask for attendance?
That too a prof from cqst
Guys it’s gonna happen fs they can’t fail more than 15% people in a course
if sec a ke log can get their heads out of their ass
Yessss
Our batch is dumb enough unanimously vote for dumb things.   Let's just vote out the prof 💀 time to bring up ChatGPT and mail spam dean
they can and they have and they will lol
ye 15% kaha se aaya
Broo please aisa math bolo guruji
Lets just make a AI that teaches us LA better than him and then we kick him out...
so sec a please just fucking apologise to the guy after class
Will they consider time stamps for cso also????
why is that so hard for yall
Meri phat ke chohothar ho rhi hai pehle se hi
nah
You prolly won't get attendance
Guys anyone please confirm I attended secb classes
we dont fucking know we domt want them to
idts he gives a shit, relax
They'd win
Seniors told apparently Dsa me in they decreased the cutoff
iirc they failed 90 ppl in dsa once
💀
Wtf 😭😭😭😭
Wth. Which prof was this
Wallahi how even-
Indranil
Sujit P Gujar
it was just a rumor tho not sure about it lol
cluster seniors ne bataya tha
Most likely
ah if that is the case i wont be surprised
Bhai pehle bolna tha itne mein Heart attack aagaya
Why are sec A peeps going out of class
lot of empty chairs now
😂 4/8/25, 12:33 PM - Shoaib: Sec A me attendance ayi kya?
Nop
For attendance in a May be
Nahi rey
12:30 is the og time for attendance in A 4/8/25, 12:34 PM - Shoaib: Kk
also nobody cross attend today ffs 4/8/25, 12:35 PM - Poonam: what's the situation 4/8/25, 12:35 PM - Poonam: Did it get escalated
Yes
He's now shooting people who are sec a
Yes abhi

it was ungraded 4/9/25, 12:30 AM - Hemang: yeah but didnt they say something along the lines of "submitting something is necessary"
idr 4/9/25, 12:31 AM - Hemang: cool thank you
That was on github
It clearly says that it doesn't require a moodle submission though 4/9/25, 10:16 AM - Hemang: Cools, it usually just goes away from the dashboard without saying "overdue"

Does anyone have a GPS module we can borrow for one day
Broooo even if you get the gps module doo you have the battery to power it?
Our TA told us that the lithium battery we'll get only after mideval
we were told the same in EW
aaj tak nahi mila
how did u show ur project in evals then, without laptops?
You had to provide your own power source, like I used an otg and powered with my phone
they said we're not allowed to use laptops/phones no 😭
Who said
Our TA didn't inform us of any of that 😭
I don't have iot idk your rules
U can use other power sources
They did mention laptops I'm pretty sure
Not sure abt phones
Noor said that laptops aren't iot devices so u can't use them to power
Cab you use laptop camera ?
Dunno
💀 that's for final evals ig.  Otherwise we'll be cooked for tomorrow, wut u mean u can't power esp32 with laptop!!?
U can use the dc power supply maybe? Unless ur doing smtn with the serial ports
ye they did mention but not sure whether they’ll check it for mid evals
Haven't tested it but most likely, using a mobile adapter works

Stalking much
damn
name drop
actually dont nvm lmao
guys i wrote this pls read 👆
super relatable and well-written you should definitely check it out
guys atleast this time PLEASE DONT do that perspective counter-perspective shit all over again we really need a hackathon in ISS, and not an endsem theory exam
@917679041770
yea if you have arguments do them here and now not on moodle
uhm, I'll write if I feel the need to, even if it's unpopular
Once anyone please send the teams list
not on moodle
but at this point, I just want hackathon, idc about teams and shit
argue it out here
also pls do vote on the iss grp for a hackathon (unless u are really interested in mugging up all the syntaxes and losing marks)
++
if u have any arguments, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't do it on moodle do it on whatsapp
Point taken
Or spam shubans dms
look, if I have points to bring out and there is an opinion conflict here, but on moodle it seems like a unanimous agreement in our batch, I will raise counter perspective in front of TAs/prof. so I'm not making any future promises, but yea I won't be discussing about ISS
then what is the problem in raising it here? moodle is supposed to be a place where we show a united front to the profs
Give one counterpoint and obh is brutally molesting you
why must we show a united front if we’re not united?
if you're going to do this flip flop in front of the prof, you're just going to be reducing the credibility of the batch
reiterating everything once again  PLEASE argue on WhatsApp and not on moodle if u are against hackathon PLEASE vote for hackathon in the ISS group (unless u are really interested in mugging up all the syntaxes and losing marks)
then dont and write a theory endsem lmao
the moment someone makes a moodle post with a counter point i will drop pushing for a hackathon
i do not want a theory endsem at all, but i believe it’s kinda unfair to tell someone to stifle their opinion on a communication platform w the higher ups just because their opinion *might* be different from the crowd
I'm pretty sure the polls say otherwise
This is the 5th time you've said this 😭
average was 5 in quiz, then in endsem we might be hitting new records. Hackathon is best
like i said, i desperately want a hackathon, i just don’t want to tell anyone to shut up
in an ideal world yea ig but i live in the real world
I think telling the TAs would be better right?
yes, knowing our batch
Cause they might be able to decide if something you want is feasible or not...
In an ideal world you wouldn't have to do this 😭
i agree with you in the practical sense that it creates an image of us being unreliable, but realistically not all 370 kids want a hackathon, and even if *only* one doesn’t, that doesn’t mean he doesn’t have the right to voice his opinion
look, I already wrote in my message, despite having counter perspectives here, if a moodle thread starts with a single narrative, I have to intervene.  And again, for the third time, I Won't be writing anything about ISS anymore.  There is just not enough discussion here before mail spam starts, and our batch has "unanimously" voted for dumb things before too.
nobody restricted u just speak out here
speak out here so that the people in charge of actually conducting the exams never get to hear my voice?
you do whatever you want then
how does that work
Wdym "unanimously voted for dumb things before too"
++
bruh do u really want an endsem?
i will simply stop pushing for this if you want to do that bs
dude
.
i mean its not wrong to voice ur opinion but think a bit for everyone just don't be selfish
why though? the mode of examination ultimately affect his grades and like it or not everyone is worried about their own grades first at the end of the day
Dude satisfying a very small minority is actively gonna fuck up the majority
if i believe an endsem will gurantee better marks for me than a hackathon, i will absolutely push for an endsem
why is the majority right though?
😭😭what are we even arguing for exactly?
they’re telling shuban to not voice counterpoints on moodle
Here the minority has an advantage, even a single voice is enough to overturn the remaining majority, which is in my opinion way more unfair
okay, that still doesn’t explain to me why you’re more right than the minority
Look, in general I agree with what Shuban said, but in this scenario, talking to TAs or asking in batch group might be better
you want a hackathon because it’s better for YOU, they want an endsem because it’s more right for THEM
If he still has a big issue, then he can go ahead and post.
It's not about right or wrong, if it's between going for the minority opinion or going for the majority opinion then yes the majority opinion should be considered more
Ideally both parties should be kept happy, but that ain't an option here
if 300 of us vote to murder the other 60 does that make us right lol
that’s not how it works 😭
this is very utilitarian 4/9/25, 6:08 PM - Poonam: it's more about the majority opinion, you're allowed to voice it out to fellow batchmates and try to change their minds but if youre not able to, you don't have the right to make moodle threads look like a shitshow civil war because then it affects credibility in front of profs
everyone should have an equal right to voice their opinion, and ultimately it comes down to sai to make his choice
If we're going with these silly scenarios, then let's consider a more equalised version to what's going on: Would you kill 60 people or would you kill 300 people? Each group votes for the other group to be killed
yeah but the people in favor of the hackathon have clearly shown they’re not willing to compromise and do an endsem, and vice versa. if the people around you aren’t willing to listen/change, what’s your next step? talk to the people who can actually bring about change 4/9/25, 6:09 PM - Poonam: in Moodle it's not 369 mails vs 1 mail, it's 1 mail representing 369 people vs 1 mail representing a counter opinion, but on the Moodle level it just looks like the batch is indecisive
Yea cause when someone makes a moodle post it sounds like a majority have a problem...
Thank you^
dropping this here I don't want a hackathon if I don't get to choose my teammates. It's not fair grading if we can't choose who we want to work with.
that comes down to wording then no?   the mail with 360 people has a poll attached to it, will have multiple people supporting it and commenting  the message by one guy will clearly be his own personal opinion and not reflective of anyone else  if sai is retarded enough to not be able to tell the difference that’s on him and not us
You are fully entitled to vote for what you want in the poll
At least with the theory endsem it's relative and individual so it's objectively fair
He wanted us to say it here before putting it on middle that's why I sent t 4/9/25, 6:11 PM - Shoaib: Fr , I don't want to be a burden to my teammates
the message with 360 people backing it will ultimately have more weight because of the things attached to it, even if it’s just one message
You don't want bickering and multiple moodle posts just arguing as that still makes us look bad
no one telling you to fight in the comments there, but if you have an opinion you should be free to share it with a detailed explanation and reasoning
come on guys calm down,  yea the reason I'd like to give out different opinion, even if minority, is to affect the credibility of the main opinion.  And it's not really valid saying 369 people 1 mail vs 1 person 1 mail, if there is a spam of majority opinion, it's evident more people want that. The minority also has to put stuff up, just so that the prof/Tas know there are other perspectives too and we can get a best of both worlds decision.
Like ponnam says, From their perspective it makes us look indecisive. And we are arguing against the incharges who are actively I favour of the minority opinion, one message is all they need to justify their decision
exactly
being in the majority doesn’t automatically give you the right to enforce your policies though
your point repeatedly is  we are majority someone goes against us majority looks weak majority loses
Yes
your argument should be strong enough to the point where a counterpoint isn’t enough to break it down, and still comes out as the better option
Coz that's what's happening 4/9/25, 6:15 PM - Poonam: the responsibility to compile and provide profs the most optimal request benefitting the highest number of people is of batch representatives, when you're sending multiple suggestions you're essentially putting the burden of decision making on the profs who will have to deal with this back and forth bs when it's not really their responsibility
The issue is we don't have time to flesh this out in more detail even if we wanted to, better to just let the majority be rather than let the indecision result in chaos
the profs are the one structuring and organizing the course, it is ultimately their responsibility though. the fact that we are able to control the direction of this course to some extent is a miracle in and of itself, just because an argument is utilitarian doesn’t mean it should be the one put forward, yes more people might end up happy, but objectively an endsem theory paper is more fair (as much as i do NOT want it)
the argument the minority makes is very fucking valid here
Come on guys Just vote for what u want If what u want isn't on the poll, mention it over here and discuss with everyone Don't just fight out on Moodle like the last time Though it was for a hackathon, it was a war against unacceptable team formation, but pls don't repeat it PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE JUST FOR THIS ONCE
Then make your case to the batch
Not to the prof
you and i both know everyone is set on their views and not changing them anytime soon
You don't email the election commissioner if you don't like the guy getting electrd
not trying to start a fight here but @919361140892 @919344529774 ur only saying all this because ur opinion aligns with the majority   even the minority's opinions should be heard by the prof since he's the one making the final call
Then that's democracy
and democracy = right to protest and free speech 😭
So protest who's saying don't protest
He's in ece 💀
writing on moodle is a form of protest
eh idt that matters it’s a principle argument
But emailing sai is wasting time which we don't have
No no he said opinion aligns with majority
So I meant it doesn't
Cuz he doesn't hv a personal benefit here
I'm not saying don't do it I'm saying it benefits no one
If they're pissed off by the spam, Sai may give a paper in which we can't even understand a word and 20% guess off like that Hackathon is on safer side
how does it waste time if it helps those who want the endsem paper potentially have the endsem be a paper
relative grading
alright guys just calm down 😭  ISS has come down to a far majority of similar opinions, after dean's hackathon rejection. 
Why didn't u guys fight before this all happened?
oh wait yeah why is he even here 😂
I'll say no to another assignment extension dw it's been too long
We had a hackathon scheduled since long ago right
btw why is the ISS group locked?
>person wants theory paper >person mails sai >sai sees counter argument to hackathon >sai sets theory paper >person happy >person benefitted
so people see the poll
Prolly cuz of what's happening in unofficial
prolly so that this fight doesnt happen there
Coz ponnam is based like that
WOOOOOHOOO thank you ece friend
but that opinion doesn't benifit anyone?
🥰
💀💀💀💀💀
What's the majority opinion here btw
pro hackathon
😭😭😭
Hackathon yes
Bcoz this while chat will be done there spamming everyone if not locked
Ohk gotcha
Okay well mostly no one saving like 3 people.
everyone wants project or hackathon in ISS
yes but my point is those 3 people are just as valid
➕
Wasn't it established that theory endsem gonna happen irrespective of hackathon or not?
Hackathon
thanks ece goat
Yeah it's like sacrificing 360 people so that 3 people can be happy
Nah tamatar sar keep up with the times🥺
i am trying to push for hackathon with the prof
yea
it benefits him if people dont submit completed assignment
ISS is a practical subject, and it doesn't work on the principle of mugging up 7-8 languages It works on trial and error with logic So a hackathon is a better idea This is my argument
Even ece guys agree with the majority opinion
an endsem is invalid that is kinda a bigger point no?
this affects the weightage of the theory paper tho
Posting individual arguments on Moodle is a horrible idea  Regardless didn't the dean say his decision will be supplemented by the majority consensus
Bas puch raha hoon dw
I don't see the problem in the people who don't want a hackathon to just vote for endsem theory. You don't see the people who want a hackathon spamming on Moodle. Why should you?
Okay
If you want an endsem vote for the endsem. Democracy will take care of the rest
but.. the plan is for them to make a moodle post though
This is already done due to which prof dropped off the idea
What
Yeah, one showcasing the poll and the votes
The Moodle post will support whatever the poll supports. If the collective majority wants an endsem, the Moodle post will vouch for endsem.
Well then it's all right to frame it that way, "dear prof, if extentions are always readily provided,... blablabla this this happens... hence no extentions"
Not an individual agenda
That's why we're about to request the prof after making a poll
the only fair way to go about is this is make a singular moodle post which argues for both sides and let sai pick, but that’s not happening
Also the thing with email threads is its the last person who emails who has the biggest say
get to work then buddy
no sleep for you
You are aggregiously misunderstanding what the Moodle post is going to do. It's going to vouch for the majority. Nothing more nothing less
that is not fair
What happened to democracy 💀
Will Sai listen to our requests after all this fiasco? I have a feeling he'll just ask us to shut up and write end sems lol
😔
yes and the point is who’s vouching for the minority 😭
im not starting this argument from the beginning again, just go up and read every point has been made
Vouch for yourself here, get more people on your side. Thats the way you vouch for the majority
😭😭why are we arguing this much if only 3 people want endsems?
I did ra that's why I'm late. Third speaker Maxx shhh strawman mentioned uwu Owo 7 minute mark no more POIs🥺🥺🥺
Who's the 3rd btw I just rounded up to 3 for funsies
Cause those three people wanna Moodle max and get the rest of us raped😭
who all want it btw 💀?
check poll
Lynch them
I see two adityas and neither of you 💀
Off to the gulag, going against the hivemind is heresy
Damn I now kinda understand the reasoning behind those Aditya hater reels
nah, it makes sense.  they think it's double work to do endsem and hackathon.  i don't agree, but I respect all opinions which seems valid
Guys what if no endsems?
I don't think double will happen
Wait endsem and hackathon?
The way prakhar sar was talking today, he was very VERY against endsems
we might be able to convince the dean?
Isn't this for only hackathon
nah
I'm pretty sure the poll is no endsem only hackathon
Yeah
oh im very pro hackathon ill kill myself before i willingly write a theory paper
wait this is for both endsem and hackathon or just the hackathon?
Bhuban get ur facts straight bruh😭
I thought just hackathon?
yea ig
It is supposed to be just hackathon
but i voted for only hackathon in the first poll few days ago too, I thought it was about that
😂
Right lads what the fuck did i miss
Nothing
Oki
Bro hackathon is stupid tho cause everyone will get marks
Right?
Wont the grading be fucked
ece detected opinion rejected
last year 90% got A or son
smn
it was 96 afaik
I don't know if you are right or wrong , most of the people prefer getting more marks rather than getting a greater score relatively. It may be shortsighted, may be not.
🤣🤣🤣
90% of the batch got an A or did the people who scored 90% got an A 💀
Who scored 90%
this sorry
After knowing this statistic , God pls tell if we should have endsem or hackathon.
last year prof was diff right.
hackathon
ya
after seeing quiz2 paper :   if we don't see hackathon, we will see god directly after end-sem paper. You can ask him then
What fhe fuck 😭😭😭 i wish i had that subject
bro
cutoff for A was 96%
not 96% of the batch got an A
After reading this, my hopes of getting an A- in ISS are lost
A- was 90 lol
Yes and I already lost more than 10%
wont our avg go down a lot after q2 marks are released
5
Is it always absolute?
Total*
no idea bro we don’t know shit about this course
Q2
who said this btw

The mail said 30
Avg of 5 is out of 24 (that's what they have checked so far)
So if total is 25, very slight change in avg is expected
Cult night starting soon, be here :)

And with the amount of cock pec shows, I don't have any interest in doing sports except for credit
how many?
Speaking of which, will I get yoga attendance too @919356351244
and at what time are the matches?
Standard 3
7pm to 10pm
You'll get three sports attendances added to ur total afaik
just for being in team
or actually playing?
@919091929888 u see what i mean?
same reason
😭😭
Khelna nahi hai to register hi kyun karte ho
Everyone bought in the auction will have to play a certain number of (currently undecided) minutes
If the medical request keeps getting pushed back to the student whom should I mail?
dont mail, meet caretaker and ask why
*attendance
.
wait we can MEET the caretaker ah!?
How does one do this🤓
Kavita maam is always in old parijat i think
atleast most of the time
since we have 200+ votes on the iss poll for the hackathon, and ~20 against, i will be posting on moodle to request a hackathon be conducted instead
Will the hackathon be conducted before endsem or after endsem ? It would be great if we unanimously decide abt that also.
why would the date change
Sorry mb forgot about the date. When is the hackathon scheduled to happen ?
19-20
I think we should also unanimously decide the grading system, endsem qs and everything else ,, 👄
that was the quiz
Nope
Everything. The dashboard, the analysis you guys might be doing, control/automation. Everything.
Bro why the fuck is this mideval might as well make it the end eval no 😭
Fr
ikr 4/10/25, 11:33 AM - Krrish Gupta: What’s the point of telling this like 4 hours before the eval
So, we are posting about the ISS hackathon request and I want to request you all to consult the batch before posting any counter reply
they gave us 0 information abt the mideval and what all were expected from us
and 4 hrs before it they tell that they want everything from us
what do they expect
They thought we knew it😔
End eval is just for the data, wtf
POLL: IoT Mid Evals OPTION: Expecting Too Much. (85 votes) OPTION: It's alright, managable. (2 votes) OPTION: Expected, all good. (2 votes) 
Pls vote asap, we'll send out a msg before this class ends
Does anyone know if n117 is open rn?
It wouldn't have mattered if they had fucking told us this atleast 1 week earlier or something

Who can't afford an absence, go to sec A
Rest enjoy in workspace
Lol, I have 1 absent in DSA and I'm still in sec A just for the thrill of it

Oh already on 4

Not yet
it is 4/11/25, 9:02 AM - Poonam: why are they doing this towards the end of semester when everyone has less leaves 4/11/25, 9:02 AM - Poonam: should've done this earlier if they want to set the rules
They will get sus again if this happens because of what happened in LA Sb last class

its been done before i believe
girl im in a
People, maybe not the right time to say this, but I have advised multiple times to keep a buffer of 2 classes. It's not that hard. Next year please, keep this much buffer
I'm just waiting for the cinema to occur when 11:40 DSA class is full
im just being helpful becasue i feel guilty 😭😭
there are like 25 peeps in class, it will be difficult to convince her💀
It is not the right time
absolutely not right timing
ok @919356351244 @916281157687 and some others and i are reliant on sports leave for that buffer
100 percent leave will be considered right?  Like it won't be counted in the 15 percent classes we can leave
?
which means reliant on nagaraju
Us with CC 😭😭😭
yo we shouldve gotten some kinda amber alert before hand
right like a mf email 4/11/25, 9:19 AM - Poonam: can't even argue about anything because being late isnt permitted, it was just excused before 4/11/25, 9:19 AM - Poonam: so annoying 😭
yeah man thats the worst part our fault onlu
i say we resort to terrorism
ay can you ask the prof to open the door 😭
or maybe snitch the secB guys
im too not-sec a to have the balls for that
yoo no 4/11/25, 9:20 AM - Poonam: What is this for 4/11/25, 9:20 AM - Poonam: 💀💀
IM THE SECTION B GUY BUDDY 😭😭😭
mb mb
if we applied for leave this sem and it got approved, does the attendance alr get updated or does it get updated end of sem
say that again, and you'll start a war
end of sem
end i believe
Even if it got approved? So ims still shows leave for the class I missed and got leave for?
Ims won't update attendance based on leave
U have to manually calculate
Arey yaar
Damn I could not have taken a leave at a better time lmao
at the end of semester theyll go and update the actual number of classes missed
Last sem the app used to update
They will only include your leave if you are absent more than the 15 percebt
But now it doesn't show anymore
At end of the sem
So rn I have to manually check the number of classes I’ve missed
Yep
I still have my ims absents even after leave last sem
so idk
ok sec a people stuck outsdie maybe you can convince the attendance guy to guve yall the machines before he enters the class
b doesnt have this option but yall do
unfortunately your attendance guy is not very nice about this
we are not locked out of sh3
we are locked out of the block😭
wait what
wdym
the main wooden gate
Yes 💀
What 💀💀💀
OH WTFFF
Oh i thought vindhya a6;
nah buddy theres no saving from that
someone in sections A turn your notifications down wtf
someone go open and close
I’m lowkey so salty ab all the sec b people who were able to go into indranils clsss
😔😔
this gate to be precise
Do the honors
Knock on the door
Maybe
im sorry bbg 😭
is there an attendance guy guarding the door?
he instructed the attendance guy not to open it i believe
</3
oh fuck
At what point will this college realise that if they have to go thru such dramatic measures to enforce this maybe there's a fundamental issue w the attendance policy as a whole Like this is lowkey funny the behaviour of a "tier one" institute locking people out and monitoring the doors
its depressing, retarded and absolutely avoids the problem of bad scheduling and useless classes
the only thing teir 1 about this college is my sleeping schedule
but hey not like itll ever get fixed right
sec a people
last resort
that too gets disturbed
pay off attendance guy
Upcoming ping article clout
How many of u guys are facing grade drops coz of this. Accordingly we cld try musteing up the the courage to ask him
Kiko will say just be on time
Nice links
Dude not the right time
Right time to advertise?
thank you, this is what we need in the middle of sec a b cinema
💀
bro took lessons in good timing from sanyam
Bye not u sending a random asec tournament message
Wrong time mb
For a college that gives so much jurisdiction for profs to decide the regulations for the class, one could argue that according to the current prof of the course we were on time  Because he was lenient with timing
This entire scenario is really funny when you aren't in any class
Idt sir gives a fuck
and from sec a
Follow up saying they are very sorry about the same
Each prof has their own policies right
SAME LOMAO
About attendance, punctuality
Put a poll to find how many are on the verge of a drop. Then accordingly we can decide to ask bro
No harm trying
Just ask na
bro he’ll kick that person out
Bruh it's scary af and it's only worth it if there's a decent number of ppl on a grade drop
zero tryst
POLL: attandance OPTION: 4+ (4 votes) OPTION: 4 (10 votes) OPTION: 4- (17 votes) 
U mean absences? What
i just woke up to this 😭
Is this absent counter?
yeah
Ya
how long does it take for leaves to get approved, its been two weeks for me
That’s there but one could also argue that we singed up for this, knowing the attendance policy and we know that we’re “supposed” to be on time to class and we just take advantage of their leniency of timings
Okay, only people who are not in any class, vote
I'm using half of my attendances just to be at home lol
Good morning
How's the room lookin
bruh
yeah wohi we have no stand because ‘8:30 class starts at 8:30’ is an unbeatable stance
bro the two attendance guys didnt let me open the door i tried being cheeky and saying i need to fill the bottle
In the words of the deputy acads dean himself  "Academic policy is a loose guideline, profs decide for their course"
didnt work na
😂😂😂tell him it’s summer
And
Dehydration
Bad 4/11/25, 9:31 AM - Poonam: 💀😭😭😭
Respect 🗿🗿
Yea u don't wanna pass out during an exam now, do you 4/11/25, 9:32 AM - Poonam: imagine 1 guy goes to fill a bottle and comes back with 50 guys
he said you can leave but i cant let you back in ill lose my job
i said alr
ok wow
and slithered back
💀💀💀 whatb
Hmmmmmm I wonder why you mentioned such a speicifc consequence 4/11/25, 9:32 AM - Poonam: insane power dynamic
Stay hydrated guys
Damn even the guards ain't safe from the shifty college schedule
indranil has said a lot of times that be on time, he’ll allow till 9, dont be late than that, that if we dont stop coming late, he’ll start locking, guess you have to come early to listen to it
Fuck
you go open the door then brave soul
no no 🥰
????  Were talking about dsa sec b We have gajjar Outta nowhere lini shows up
ahh
Fair
that’s just sad
People can leave in bulk after attandance, then ig door will be open
uh guys is it showing absent on 3rd march dsa for some people?
yea thats some crazy gut punch
wont help
Was it informed that it’ll be lini
I'll go to acads office today about the 3rd april thing, too many ppl are absent for it to be a personal issue
no
theyll let people out not in
tysm
Lmao i love how you remember this line it's so iconic
They're not really supposed to inform us when it's lini tho. Like we're supposed to be on tym
How could one forget
they informed last time iirc
doesn’t mean that they have to every time
true
also you can do as much bitching as you want about the attendance policy, its not going to change unfortunately please do not go to the dean or acads office with your complaints, the reasons i am seeing on this group will get you laughed out of the office and give our batch a bad name at least when it comes to this
youre being kinda unhelpful though so if your point is just to berate other people exit the discussion
yea but what if i love gajjar so such much that i need to mental prepare for a change in prof
imagine dean academics when he sees 50+ leave applications soon
😭 nobody was gonna do that
Fair enuf
I was just bitching 😔
fact : A gun can increase your probability of winning an argument
it’s purely practical, like think from the prof’s pov too
we’re in the disaster management discussion not disaster is invalid discussion
Kavita vemuri time
profs pov se think kaise kare
they dont have to be accountable to our latecoming
their pov is pointless
yea but it is kinda disrespectful for them
From a profs pov why do they want everyone to listen to them or whatever. If u teach well ppl will automatically listen to u. Also why lock the door knowing damn well ppl get grade drops etc
yea true but they try, if they fail kya hi kare
indra just said
did anyone sneak in kya
lmao
Whatd he say
indranil seems to be lowkey enjoying this, he's smiling a bit
"Lock the door make sure ppl don't come in "
"L to gyatts who are outside edgin" translated in UG1 words 4/11/25, 9:41 AM - Poonam: unless someone can quantum tunnel through that door idts 💀
no see its on us no q of that but its sad cuz we’re powerless
yea
just sleep 10 mins less
the extra 10 mins tho
✨✨✨
😔😔
like ideally there should be a buffer or cushion of some kind na
There is a buffer
half an hour buffer is more than enough 😭😭😭
but again ideally
33% of the class
nah i think they should just move classes back by 30 mins to 1 hour
for gajjar class bro
so 9-930 start
oh lini is just
like cushion of telling its lini
too idealist
lmao
agreed entirely
Ong
I think next year onwards we won’t have such bad timings
the theory is our batch gets extra fucked cuz of chathpt
just a few more classes 🔥 we got this
sem1 we might’ve
does anyone have dsa/la present/absent on 24th february? does anyone remember if we had a class that day?
Hm but not everyday atleast
bro, we went to sec b, saw lini, opened the door once, she says "go, you cannot come", and we were like "ok", and left, cuz theres no point
or we could pay the attendance guy to teach us how to program the machine and then steal one
Man they have a paper with codes
U have to enter it
lifetime payout or a stable job hmmmmm interesting choice
not me, for neither courses 4/11/25, 9:44 AM - Sarthak Mishra: I have a DSA present on 24th, but no record in la on 24th
Can't fingerprint attendance be manipulated in sm way. I remember sm hacks
same
Typical dasa has more money
wax fingerprints
okay was there class that day?
adventurer, u are not high enough level to unlock this region of the map
I don't remember
neither do i oof
okay thanks
i said everyone pitch in bruh, you act like i sleep on money 💀
ok why do i have a dsa absence on 4th april
what was 4th april
email them, i mailed them it was fixed for me

Same
Monday we don't have LA or DSA
So if I smoke enough weed I can get inside
send me your mail ill copy paste
ik, but was class shifted? no naaa
idk, I didn't come to class too
we did have a quiz
i was just checking that lol
dsa quiz attendance counts
3rd ko we had quiz
pick 33 hairs off Lini for +4 exp
don't do that
Too late
i sign my name on attendance sheet and it’s mentioned in the mail, i dont think it’ll work for you
ah alrighg
I now have +4 slaps to the face instead of exp this ain't what I was promised man
I need to fix, report this bug #56628
bro what is this brainrot
cmon
I'm in LA, what do u expect
just sleep
It's not brainrot it's brain nourishment
in 10 mins I'll convert back to human, I just wanna leaveeeee
YEAHH bro there was washroom cleaning happening he didn't lemme go out even then
😭😭
i also have a miss in dsa april 4th
email
what did sir teach on 4th btw?
yea i was in class
People who are outside, request Indranil for attendance
He might allow
lini ma'am is asking why an astonishingly low number of ppl showed up to class today
lmaooo
She doesn't deserve to ask
Tell her to wait for Sec A class
Be prepared for this in dsa class.
Im showing up at 11
L to all of us who have other classes
pranshul ki mkc 🙏
like if they attend section a class, they'll get attendance there right... lini won't kick them out for being section b?
Might kick out 4/11/25, 10:40 AM - Ojas Kataria: Who dis
ta told me informally
Damn tas personally sending guruji help crazy connections guruji has 🙏
how will lini find out?
overfull class
ye karo
Bring your own chairs
Sneak them in and sit
Pls someone ask lini is she going to take the next class or not
Pls unpin this , iot mid evals are over.
she will re
so sir will not return?
he might for next classes, not sure
Dear Students  Only Group A should be coming for the DSA 11:40am class. We will mark attendance outside the class on paper and let you in. only this attendance will hold
Lini ma'am
who df snitched
"You will come to know that in the next class" was what lini said
so thats why the tas asked me where sh3 was
Vedant you snitched
😡
unbelievable
shit, gonna grade drop lol
How so chill
Ideally sir should be taking the next class, because she had said that she'd take *1* class in H2
😂lite
??
He didn't intend to do that.
He's just a chill guy
Lite I know
I was jk
I read it as "hackathon" 😭😭
The trauma is deep
Lmao no hackathon
so… section b kids who missed morning dsa have no chance
should we still give it a try tho 💀
you could... maybe just go and sit in class pehle se
But attendance is taken outside right
Will they have a list? Of section A students?
Before the TAs come hide in class
😭 point stil stands you'll still have to go and give attendance outside
you wont get attendance then
How will that help?
but we won't get attendance right
isn't it only manual
i dont follow how the tas + paper attendance will allow any sneakage
right i misunderstood it pehle
its only paper attendance apparently
so no chance
:(
why wont she let us attend
it makes no sense 4/11/25, 11:08 AM - Poonam: whys she so hellbent on fucking people over
like the net number pf people shes teaching will be low asf
how does that benefit her
no
Wot
It's the entirety of section A?
thats machine attendance
plus indranil doesnt gaf
form b na 4/11/25, 11:09 AM - saanvi jain: she likes fucking us over
both sections matter 4/11/25, 11:09 AM - Poonam: now they wont be able to attend DSA in SH3 no?
nope
idts 4/11/25, 11:10 AM - Poonam: aren't you fucked asw 💀
we’re not fucked for LA thats all 4/11/25, 11:10 AM - Poonam: yeah LA is fine 4/11/25, 11:10 AM - Poonam: but damn crazy
for dsa yeah we have an absence
Wait will they check sections for previous attendances now
lini is a good prof but this is a bit cruel
hopefully not
Yeah what's stopping me from putting and cutting😭
Lol ya i was thinking the same
Kshitij my goat
++ let's me sleep first bench 4/11/25, 11:11 AM - Poonam: once your attendance is marked theyll drag you in and lock the door and you have no choice than to listen to her 🔥
Lmao
I have only one counterargument for thus
"W A S H R O O M" 4/11/25, 11:12 AM - Shoaib: This attendance policy of lini is so retarded 4/11/25, 11:12 AM - Shoaib: Gajjar is goated, secure about his teaching capabilities 4/11/25, 11:12 AM - Poonam: lini prolly sat down and figured out a way to fuck over the most number of people possible
People still sit in his class also big W 4/11/25, 11:13 AM - Shoaib: Yup cause he teaches good 4/11/25, 11:13 AM - Shoaib: Lini also teaches good but she shouldn't be this strict with timings 4/11/25, 11:13 AM - Shoaib: It looks really immature
i mean discipline is a reasonable expectation
we were disciplined w her timings in H1
the issue is w not informing that today’s lini
On the other hand, Lini was not interested in doing this today
and then lini deciding to ensure that people _cannot_ attend her class if they didnt in the morning slot
She waited until 9:40, then she saw that there were only 40 students
Incl. seniors
So much for PJN saying college is for exploring your interests and then smacking us with 85% attendance crap 4/11/25, 11:15 AM - Shoaib: But it just feels wrong to school college students who are grown enough to figure out what's good for them
it would have been a lot better for every single person for them to just conduct today’s 11:40 class in a lecture hall
iiit schools us by forcing arts, sports and class attendance
we’re in a glorified boarding school with the only nice factor being no locked gate 4/11/25, 11:16 AM - Shoaib: Fr I hate these extra credits 4/11/25, 11:16 AM - Shoaib: 😞😞
and im pretty sure this is only so that they are not bad mouthed and so that suicides are fewer and easier to cover up
Conspiracy theory that IIIT is run by therapists who want to make a quick buck
Unrelated but mess ka last  controversy hoke bahut time hogaya
only one way to know
IIIT: ~Allow time for sports~ Force timings for sports
Tbf most of us wld have 0 physical activity if they didn't force it upon us
and? it isn’t their responsibility to force it upon us
in fact
I still don't understand why we can not have attendance in other slots, like bruh, I came for sports that's what you want from us, right?
i’d argue that excellent sports facilities and good returns upon sports participation is a fantastically better way to encourage sports
rather than have people run in circles
I mean you can always sneak in, but they don't officially allow it so..
has anybody who didnt play sports before improved/liked/begun a sport due to this circus bs?
High risk, low reward though
valid 💀
Their only argument for that is overcrowding in a slot, and thus running out of equipments  But that won't happen everyday?! Happens only when the end of semester is close and everybody wants attendance
there was a fly in the south mess custard just two weeks ago br
I've stopped playing sports 😬
Oh LMAO
lini clutched again
Clutched?
Harris what the fuck 💀
wdym
lmao
I record the masses reaction live
Oh hey I see in the bg
Lookin straight into the camera
section a ppl give us drama
shes let anyone come in
but they will cross verify for attendance
ah accha
All laptops and phones closed smh
Test??
nah
we didn't have
oh wait his phone is off
Nooooo he won't get the mesdage
Ye

For those that have absences on DSA on 3rd April, and CSO on 5th April (i.e., on the day the quizzes were conducted), please take pictures of your corrected answer sheets with your roll number on them during paper showing and mail it to badri.rayi@iiit.ac.in to get your attendance marked. In CSO, since we are not allowed to take pictures of the paper, please ask the TAs to mail it on your behalf. 4/11/25, 11:55 AM - ~ Vedant K pinned a message
For CSO, I talked to the head TA, please mail Arihant Jain (arihant.j@research.iiit.ac.in) about it, and cc badri.rayi@iiit.ac.in.

lol i saw this from outside and started laughing
you'll should start writing in one sentance 4/11/25, 4:08 PM - Eashaan Thakur: Can we book flights from 7th may onwards? All of our exams will be over by then right?
Yep but u might want to stay for paper showing.. if that's lite then it should be over 4/11/25, 4:12 PM - Eashaan Thakur: Thanks!
is everyone leaving before 10th?
lmao
when will we get the question bank though
same doubt 4/11/25, 5:22 PM - Ojas Kataria: Imagine if the question bank is like 200 questions
imagine doing DSA in Assembly
it is 12 questions only afaik😭
@917010674428 pls lets not give the ta's ideas to make the lab harder
😭😭
how does it make the lab harder
cuz then we don't know the difficulty level
but the purpose of a lab exam is to test practical skills
and by giving the question bank in advance, u are just making it obsolete
ur making ts harder for the rest of us
I agree but not all of us are sushils so give us a chance :)
last year it was only 9 qs apparently
sir people here have cleared jee 💀
all im saying is new war
didn't intend to do any mode-of-admission based discrimination 💀
let them set easier questions, the thing is to just not give them in advance
why do you care whether they give a question bank or not??
it's like giving the questions of all graded dsa labs beforehand
what if you don’t see the question bank and go give the lab exam
Bruh what
the reason they're giving the questions is because they're testing our assembly skills not dsa skills but the questions are dsa-ish
so stop trying to increase our workload 4/11/25, 5:42 PM - Eashaan Thakur: This
im pretty sure people here can memorize 50 lines of assembly 4/11/25, 5:43 PM - Eashaan Thakur: Let it be there loss na, why do you care?
yeah exactly stfu
WOOOHOOOOOOOO 4/11/25, 5:43 PM - Shoaib: Man just let me give the exams
i propose Chennai express
so lets just give dsa graded lab questions beforehand?
yeah works for me
Yes please 🙏
Yessir 🔥🔥
tujhe kya jarurat hai bhai tera toh chatgpt hai na lab mein
at the end of the day it's relative grading, so the practical component needs to be evaluated properly if it has to be a fair game
What
Aarnav Pai what's buttermilk in kannada?
Dear Lokesh Venkatachalam,  Regards.
INNNNNN WOOHOOO
I was pressured 4/11/25, 5:46 PM - Eashaan Thakur: Don't make it seem like you already don't know all the DSA lab questions, sure the dataset is bigger but you've already done similar problems before right? 4/11/25, 5:46 PM - Shoaib: Yess 4/11/25, 5:46 PM - Sarah Roomi: but wont a person who can memorise a lot benefit against someone who actually understands the concepts but cant memorise utna..?
that doesn't make sense lol if you're given the questions beforehand you'll just mug up the syntax and go.. thats what happened last year
What's the problem if they test my memorization skills though? Let them no🤓🤓
MAJIGGE
NIN TAINA AJJIGE
ILLA NIMM AJJI GAY
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wtf bhai isme bhi dikkat hai kya😭
no what no that wasn't expected what
Bc acha bhala question bank milt ha hai
Bruh u r not in a competition here chill
AYO SUMNE IRO
Regardless of the competition bro is coming first anyways there's no loss for him anyways🫡🫡
ok bro lets not have exams only then, give everyone A grade and 10 cg, lets make the world a happier place 🥰
🍿
imo i agree with sushil, giving the questions beforehand makes no sense but in the interest of not seeing 90% of the batch fail cso, i will keep my mouth shut on the course groups lmao
tu ruk agle saal 😂😂
(I don't have CSO)
I don't care about grading pattern anymore
Thank u guruji you are a responsible kassi representative
Or grades in general
The lab exam itself is stupid, why should you be expected to write assembly? We have compilers for that
ey thats the point of the course we can't argue on that lmao
also when else will you simdeeze
Instead the exam should be writing a rust compiler for the architecture discussed in pjns class
Port llvm obv
Its trivial.
he doesn't even have the course 😭 he's trolling
Complete with async trait support ofc
At this point I don't either da😭
Bhai kyu pehle se hi it’s been hectic for people like me (not all) it’s been the same for last few years why do you people wanna change not all can manage c,cpp, iss and assembly too at least im dumb enough to give up on everything, pata chala end mein questions tough hai laude lag gaye toh
I also agree with Sushil, giving free 10 cg to everyone has no reason to be scrutinized
Everyone should get a 10 cg so that we do not fight a war amongst ourselves and take down the bourgeois administration in a bloody and holy class war
Yall dense asf icl theres free marks up for grabs. You dont even have to memorize you just have to... understand how to do it.
Students of the world, unite!
Those who want to memorize 600 lines of assembly will memorize those who want to understand will understand those who want to go in blind will go in blind lmao
This is like the first open goal we're getting this entire sem do you want the keeper to snatch the ball from your feet lmao
Avg chd person:
cso tas are hilarious lmao "but you don't have the cards" 😂😂 4/11/25, 6:07 PM - Ayush: Stop making fun of victims
I don't get why olympiad sama chans don't want us to get the marks😭
To someone who gets 100 how does it matter if the peasants get 40 or 60😭
they've already done the dsa part so for them it doesn't make a difference   they're trying to fuck over the rest of the batch so their relative grade increases
shameful behaviour 4/11/25, 6:14 PM - Shoaib: Type of ppl to elect trump
All the talented people out there not all people want this and please try to understand that not all can manage this SHIT so please think twice before doing something on course group
what's going on 😭
LMAO WHAT LMAOO
In short
whyyyyy?
Guess ill know tomorrow 6 pm
lol
The leopards want to eat everyone's face
I mean, if they give the problems away we would have to spend a lot of time working on the solutions. that is a lot of time wasted. if the problems aren't given, just spend some x time working on the syntax and go to the exam.
Since when is PEC not taking manual attendance?
Bruh are peeps actually fighting because of CSO question bank
You don't have to spend time on the problems, you can just look at the syntax and go
Kassi mfs
i don't know enough assembly to trust myself to do that
wait why can my keyboard autosuggest based on chat history (me slowly remembering what all career ending data my keyboard has collected so far)
Fbi agent knows that u should follow the hivemind, doing the lords work
I mean ur career gonna end even if u don't have any incriminating evidence against you and u give ur phone to someone
rust mentioned, ima retract my 😂
thx for the tut, I watched the video 4 times, wait lemme zepto a snake
Haan so you do that no daaa why drag me down😭
...
Hari you know more assembly than 99 percent of the population here😭
I learnt it along with the course only 😭
I mean I honestly don't think there's any point in solving a problem in assembly directly, what they should be testing is your ability to optimise assembly code  Like given this code try and figure out how to reduce the number of lines of code, and you're given marks based on the number you reduce It's not DSA 2.0 so why treat it like it
You're arguing for the wrong thing imo
Arguing at all is wrong here. Why do something that'll harm everyone in the batch but you?
I would say removing the lab exam would work then
an assignment would do the trick
Real but it's free marks
If you are really for standing up for academic integrity of the course or what not then that's simply not your job. If the prof doesn't give a fuck why should you😭
I don't want to spend time trying 11 problems -_-
You don't need to no da you can already dsa max it and study and go like you would if the TAs chose your side🥺
maybe suggest this 🤔
assembly syntax too weird
Whenever we have tried to change something in a course structure it has only come to bite us in the ass
Let us not.
Is just complicated C, ~or say C++~ 😂
iss 😭
deepak honestly seems like a much better guy than sai
At least one can't get 100%+ in Sai's course
wtf, you haven't taken the course so -_-
I read that as deepseek
deepseek is also a much better guy than sai
sai is literally an AI
He has no mindpower of his own, he inputs everything into an LLM and takes its advice
Wait why do we hate sai again? He's making us write code in assembly?
Is this not ISS Sai?
Iss sai
People, take things lite
ISS Sai hackathon endsem fuck up midsem quiz 1 quiz 2 website labs
No point arguing and ranting on things you can't do anything about
convince ppl not to leave the class.. talking to the prof will just result in you listening to an unskippable cutscene
afaik it was the seniors who left
yup ;_;
Cso?
first part ain't going to happen lmao
btw for CSO also the prof might suddenly get strict, so come on time for everything
like how do you even do it
Section A exists 🫠
i know some of the seniors so i was going to try and talk to them
we'll see how that goes lmao 4/11/25, 6:52 PM - Ayush: To the people who leave cso class right after attendance please sleep or start doomscrollin
upon that the thing is we would be talking to seniors
but I am p sure he is already pissed
yes he is
tas were clear about that
so unless we speak to him about it, he might still give bad grades 4/11/25, 6:53 PM - Ayush: Literally anything is better than infuriating a prof
what do you want to go and say to him tho
Pls forgive us sir our batch is retarded sir pls
Best thing you guys can do is to go to CSO class on time, all of you for the next three lectures and participate in class
Believe me, it will sort things out a lot
something along the lines: the TAs told you were upset about it. really sorry about that but that was a small part of the batch and primarily seniors. We would make sure this doesn't happen again and if it does we'll personally report that to you.
But only if you all do this
snitching on seniors eh
when the seniors left, the prof asked them to like stay.. he said excuse me and all but they ignored and left and he told us specifically that he will find those students and told us to inform them that "if those ppl see a drop in their grade, nothing will be done"
now im hoping he meant only those students 4/11/25, 6:56 PM - Ayush: Yeh
Is moodle down or smth?
he probably did 4/11/25, 6:56 PM - Ayush: I think he meant a drop for them only because he stated he would find them
you could do this ig
maybe leave out the personally report part
Not a bad idea, what they gonna do?
yeah so all im saying is it a good idea to tell the prof that we think that he will screw our grades?
hmm, if we tell him it won't happen again and they do it what do we do at that point
🤷 fair enough
nwe never mention about grades
thy can be our ta's next sem
@917745090290 dekh liyo, if you feel there's a need and prof is quite pissed off, just send it on announcements group and try to make it happen
makes sense
I'll go talk to them
I'll do that anyways if i see them today
who are the seniors in section a?
oh okay 4/11/25, 6:58 PM - Ayush: I heard the condition is section b is worse?
na na just branch ik some chd seniors ill see about cnd
I've seen both CHD seniors and UG-1s leave lmao
not really, because only like 30 ppl show up to class
By the way, after today's DSA incident, I think our grades are gonna be quite bad this sem in all subjects
oki
What incident 💀 4/11/25, 6:59 PM - Ayush: That don't make it any better dawg 😭
class attendance thing
30 people on time
Ah, that
Depends on which prof grades
DSA, lini only
I'm there to help vedant doing my part
Bruh
Mam got pissed real quick, sorry state of affairs 4/11/25, 7:00 PM - Ayush: What happened?
How u so sure ?
She is a senior prof., so
Yeah  Anyone would be pissed if you would walk away on their face
he was even fine with ppl coming 10 15 minutes late but ppl were walking in after 50 minutes lol
True….
And leaving just after attendance
Plus we are asking them to change this and that every next second
Yes, that's even worse
Please don't say atleast for the larger courses when every course I have is a larger course 😭
See, CND profs (except you know whom) don't care that much. They are quite chill
Sooo how fucked are we
Lol true 😂
Truly everyone is a UG1 hater 4/11/25, 7:05 PM - Ayush: Real madrid
Oh noo
skill issue pratush
Profs, admin, seniors all
I didnt do shit its yall fault smh /j
Okay profs I get , was never able to get why seniors ??
We're annoying as fuck lmao
And they just haters (UG2 peeps)
Trust me a good amount of seniors who hate us are those losers who stay stuck in their rooms and dont touch grass
Otherwise most of them are solid 4/11/25, 7:08 PM - Ayush: Not a good look on your digital footprint
My brother in christ there is WAY WORSE on my digital footprint 4/11/25, 7:10 PM - Ayush: But tbf we can be really annoying especially annoying during paper checking, TAs look like they hate their lives even if I'm polite so
See the thing is
EVERYONE AND THEIR MUM HATES US FOR 75% PERFECTLY VALID REASONS
AND THESE MFS HAVE THE POWER TO FUCK US UP *BAD*
Its like pushing a referee
LETS NOT FUCK UP ANY MORE plz
Otherwise 85% will be the fail percentage not the attendance requirement
For example, ISS TAs are also quite pissed off because none of us appreciate the amount of work they are doing. While I agree they are being paid, you guys don't appreciate the effort they are putting into making lab activities and all. A little appreciation and adjustment is all it takes. They have told me multiple times how angry they are at the batch. Consider that, the endsem paper showing will be done by then only.  This is just an example, this was done by us in other courses as well.
It's similar for Zia and AEC as well. He gonna cook us in his grading 😔
don't glaze the bourgeoisie
Fr😭😭
Bro that doesn't fucking mean you don't give him feedback at _ALL_
I'm not gonna just shut up about a prof no matter how bad he is JUST because he "has good grading"
Of course I don't mean you have to shit on the prof but constructive criticism is still important
not everyone has greeeat marks like u da
the point is if you give him feedback he'll atleast try to change something about how things have been happening, which may just end up helping the rest of the batch too
Yeah we all know what happens when kassis get involved
You can't just be like "oh lite I have to do it all myself let the prof just give good grading" cause half of the shit Zia teaches I couldn't even find outside until very recently
Give feedback by mailing the prof, meeting in person
Or by filling the feedback form
Damn how did we let the E*X fuckers take over our banter
That works
Yeah exactly
The feedback form is meant for this
if anything he probably cares more if people participate in class or not, and is more pissed off by that
Guys
Gayme night
H-103
FUCK there's gayme night today? goddammit
Yessss
Rn
Guys pull up
cool
istg its always when im not there or have tons of shit to do!
Does anyone have mac charger in Workspace
+
our batch are decent people but we are horrible students like it’s valid how much shit we get from tas and profs 💀
smh youre supposed to console me and tell me im not annoying not agree with me smh
(/j)
this is not directed at anyone perosnally
i know i know im just joking 4/11/25, 10:54 PM - Gautam 016: What are the timings for morning sports?
6:30 - 7:30
am, obv
nvm got it
You're not annoying bruh ignore the haters

MITROOOOO THE BRAINROTXMEME QUIZ IS OUTT
The questions are gonna be both indian and international brainrot
I guarantee that everyone is gonna be able answer atleast half the questions
Never again are you gonna get paid for brainrot JOINNN OK
Am I too boomer to not comprehend whatever u r writing?
Yes.
Thanks, i am safe 😌
Its not just brainrot theres also a lot of meme culture sprinkled in itll be fun :D
Why is on 13th 😭
Pls shift the date I need to participate in this
What happened in ISS class sec b
Why did he leave suddenly
We nearly didn't get attendance
Sir finished class and left before attendance came
Prof's gone
Attendance is barely here
Oh damn
Hmm
Bro had demons to summon
Daemons
It's on 15th!!!
Guys the quiz questions are absolutely 10/10 goated seriously there are so many amazing questions there just WOAAAW
Where do I sign up
any news on when to vacate the hostel? is it still 10th may
Check announcements group sometimes please
There is no issue if you are leaving late, even till 17-18th
If you are planning to stay afterwards, please meet the hostel in charge and explain to them the reason
Yeha i wanted a follow up buddy
Ok this is what i wanted to know
okay
Afterwards as in after 17-18th, just clarifying
Vpn down?
Anyone have a thermometer in ws? Urgent
Does anyone have a breadboard I can borrow for ONE HOUR please😭
when is the tut quiz 2 for La?
16
alright cool thank you
if anyone is coming from obh to basketball court/nilgiri/jc anything please dm
plsss guys vote no in the cso poll
YES PLS we cant deal with cso immediately after iss
Cso will be in the morning or evening if this happens??
not confirmed yet
worst case it will be in the morning
I mean ig it's fine as long as it's in the evening? We'll be done w our papers earlier too n we can try to understand their perspective??
But guys, think of it from the seniors' perspective Would any of _you_ be willing to write two endsems, for a total of 8 credits on one single day? Would _you_ be willing to sit through a gruelling 6 hours, having no time to prepare for either exam properly? I think not. And if you would not be willing to do so, why can't we help out our seniors by swapping the two exams? Yes, we get a little lesser time for CSO, but if we were in their shoes, I'm certain that the moodle spam would have begun a while ago. As long as the exam is in the evening, I would suggest that we swap.
ok this is a new twist
what exam do the seniors have ?
MDL
It too is taken by Parchuri, if anyone wanted an idea as to how the course is
Speaking of Parchuri , I am sure these seniors weren't disrespectful to the prof and haven't possibly messed up our grading.
no lol
dsa lab
You surely can't be dumping the blame wholly on our seniors, have you seen section B's CSO classes?
grade matters more than a free day
Oh mb Forgot about that
Is that confirmed? Lokesh sir was saying something about 25th or smth yesterday iirc
When is it
brother theory starts on 25 wym
dsa theory is 25
😞😞why u seniorcock sucking da😞😞
prof isn't annoyed by an empty class , he is annoyed by people who leave immediately after attendance. The problem in section A is much worse than section B.
Let's get it postponed to May 4th instead🥺🥺
no we have dsa lab then
dates haven't been confirmed
May 4/5/6 is not even a possibility unless everyone is willing to stay back on campus (even if 1 person is not available) we won't even think of that option
Lund
This is what he told na
It starts on 26th
cant seniors get mdl preponed ?
yes but there have to be 3 labs
it doesnt work either way
or atleast 2
lmao. no one will be singing your anals of goodwill.
Sure...
unless our schedule is  23 cso lab 24 dsa lab 25 dsa lab 26 dsa theory paper  which is...
i dont need to explain why thats disgusting
@mps will sports be there after endsems?
But one also wouldn't want to be known for not helping people when they have the ability to do so
Tell me why they cant prepone/postpone MDL ? I think they don't have DSA labs like we do.
not everything is done for praise
its empathy lol
Empathy needn't be one side always.
then vote no? whos stopping you
@919941637224 please ask the seniors why they aren't doing this ....

Anyone who’s willing to swap dsa graded lab( I’m in sec A)?
same secA plaj sar halp sar
Backup?
My old phone can't even be accessed and I didn't really backup
Hi mirani
We have started guys, show up to Yuktahaar if you want to help!
You also have the chance to enter yuktahar and yell slurs at it without actually having to eat the shitty food they normally serve there (the food today should be good tho)
(@kadamb trolls)
Why are we not informed about anything -_-
Ppls show up to yuktahaar if you want to flex cooking skills :< (or if you just want to have fun :) )
Assignments nahi hote to pakka flex karne aata 😞
Aa jaa regardless :)
This one I have said multiple times, come to a conclusion and send a request via your batch representatives
Some MP, pls raise this
Quoted Lokesh Venkatachalam sir on Sec A Thursday lab request
Any mp, pls don't
Cue "that sign can't stop me coz I can't read hindi"
@918368609506 our section A goat
And also I'm not even in campus on Tuesday, I made plans on the basis that we have labs on Thursday and not Tuesday
i am out of loop
kya raise karna hai😭
too bad buddy
Yeah too bad for you guys as well
Enjoy Tuesday lab
oh lab swap
I do understand that having a lab "earlier" than us is kinda unfair but having it be swapped with ours at this time would be way mor unfair
only 1 lab left na now
studying for the lab also helps btw
do we still need it?
Thanks, I decided not to give a shit
Lmao
At least for the end lab. We had all the graded labs first even mid lab. So it would be fair for us to have the end lab after them 4/13/25, 5:21 PM - Ojas Kataria: It's on the same day, does it really matter who goes first
If it is on the same day then no. But is it confirmed?
when does the doc in aarogya come in the evening?
One should be there rn. They sit from 4 to 6 pm iirc
He is there rn
Today for lab 12
yea acc to oj
It shows more than a day left
Did they change?
It got extended no
Yeah ig
Anyone wants to swap lab I am in section a
Sab yuktahar ke bahar wala rangoli dekhte jaana🥺
Sundar bana hai bohot🥺🥺
do we have a holiday tmrw?
nope
is moodle down
nope
Ok
can someone tag that message of the midsem LA portions from the tb
ch1- 1.2 ch3- 3.0,3.1,3.2,3.3 ch4- 4.1,4.2,4.3 ch5- 5.1,5.2,5.3 ch7- 7.1 Someone else also confirm
thankyou
what ab whatever we’ve done since then 4/14/25, 3:02 AM - Anish 319 ECE: Anyone who wants to swap DSA graded lab 🙏 I have Tuesday lab
~Today~ Monday, 21st
Yes we do, pls write an email regarding the same after consulting secA ppl
Bruh like there's just 1 lab left which is  tmrw. How can u even expect them to swap it during the last minute?
Anyone wants to swap  I need Thursday lab 🙂 4/14/25, 9:56 AM - Manan: Worth trying
@918688380432 Could've emailed it for the better of all secA ppl
Exactly
Would have been fair if this swapping was decided last week. Announcing about the swap to sec B ppl one night before the lab isnt fair. It's obvious that majority of us start the lab prep only 2 to 3 days prior...
For swapping the Labs individually we should mail the proffs
TAs
Lokesh Sir precisely
Ya, this
There has been no change of now> If Section A students want that change really badly, mail to profs /Post on Moodle with your reasons.
Some days ago
why can't we start a moodle thread?it's not fair to ask them to switch the labs but i think if we ask them to postpone our lab then they might do it na
No iot class ryt
Class is there
Brother
Gand fatengi
I don't trust u
yea
Proof?
Class is h205
Proof for what
Where does it go
Prof yaar
Proff
Lol

ig, the number?
this guy truths 🔥 4/14/25, 1:50 PM - Satvik Shrivastava: truths insanely 4/14/25, 2:11 PM - Ojas Kataria: modern aah Pinocchio

Summer break

Tfg
People, UG1 votes will be deleted anyways
You guys take it lite
Bruh
Will tantra be cheaper if this passes? 4/14/25, 3:52 PM - Ojas Kataria: It's only for the summer break lmao
@917497808993
This
kadamba was supposed  to be rennovated by 20th march

Ooo nvm then

20th march ka kya hua par
Yes

What votes
Crazy
aur fir humne extension maange to nakhre karte hai
300 is an over approximation 180-190 hi ho pate hain
Nahi I've gone at 11 30 11 50 and the token number reaches 270 280
When I went at 11 50 I got 18p
Idk ups and downs ig
I once got 318 lol
When it was near guest house
Tab to jaata tha
yepp, recently bhi ek din gaya tha, maybe high demand
why though, was it because that was indoor?
Indoor no mosquitoes better tables
Friday ko higher demand hoti hogi ig, considering mess menu that day?
Makes sense. Mosquitoes are honestly the biggest issue
lol yes
Plus it was closer to OBH ( mostly log wahi rehte hai )
lazy ppl
Closer to OBH while also not being far from Parijat
and bakul
Bakul se to dur tha na
brother

Course feedback is going to start from 16th Let's spam negative feedback on ~ISS~
Please note that the farewell will be taking place in the coming few days, and security will be conducting random bag and room checks for any batch. Please cooperate with security and do not participate in any activity against hostel rules. Any violations of the rules will be met with extremely strict disciplinary action.
this includes kettles?
kettles is against the rules?
Kettles filled with ~beer~
yeah
technically
tf what even maggi is illegal now?
Huh???
Where does it say this
there was a hostel thingy
lemme see if I can find it
Then where are people supposed to get hot water from? 😭
i hacve a kettle and an induction of my own bro im fucked myself
I'm p sure it's fine so many people I know have kettles
Checking will primarily be for abusive substances
Baaki sab lite lo
i think kettle they might let it slide but induction of your own probably not
alr
Ye theek hai par kettle mana karna is actually really stupid 😭
Like why is it even a rule to begin with?
fire hazard
that
Then where do they expect people to get hot water from
Because no cooler has temperatures anywhere close to what is needed
People take it lite for now
i mean technically to fir phones and laptops are also fire hazards
no clue
Does the guard not keep kettle for you guys
no we dont live in a 5 star hotel :(
I don't think so? I've never seen the guard at the E block desk ever
the guard keeps a lovely smile and some newspapers which is good enough
Damn
We have a kettle and common induction 🙏
Lucky
5 star hotel
Okay
Will we be having yoga today??
Yogesh asking for yoga is crazy
Guys pu saranga hall for start up aid marketing session
Niligiri 119
Hallo are LA and DSA notes up to date @917075970819
➕ mwe neeeds noots too
No
They will be tonight for sure
hey guys   pro tip: they can’t ask you to open your luggage  make of that what you will
that is not a guarantee
if it’s locked they can’t
again
especially if it’s conveniently your roommates and they’re not in your room
dont try to be oversmart
you can’t throw a whole induction cooker away can you
what other option do you have
"Bhaiyya my bus leaves in 2 minutes very urgent bye bye"
Take these things lite
guys just cover your belongings with religious cloth
The checks are for abusive substances
How many times I have to tell you guys about it
Dasa money
Say its an offering or something
oh induction cooker aa i thought you were talking about something else only
They won't ttouch
this
Telangana mein bjp nahi hai 🤣
bhai😭😭😭
Aah, the CCP is gonna come and take over IIITH eh???

Abusive substances are a skill issue, abuse your substances like a real man 4/14/25, 8:38 PM - Poonam: exhaust fans changing mess menus 😭
The humble Goshamahal
exhaust fans changed germany's demographics too
@ecx people help 😞

exhaust fans kept Saddam Hussein in hiding
What is a stupid menu
Saddam Hussein mentioned
Best hiding place in the world
Swap garded lab Want Thursday U get tomorrow
"Garded"
okay so I just wanna know something..
what?
Tf?
is this about cso
I think he is talking about library
yeah library
no no library
Genius
food and drinks i think
because you're not allowed to take bags inside
can anyone like give an explanation 😭😭🙏
yeah why is my question
Because book in bag steal without issuing woah
we cannot take any sort of textbooks inside eitherways right so why don't they just check that when we go and then when we come out check our bags again for textbooks
probably to stop people from having food in there
they can just check the bag na 😭😭
Logistical overhead
Frfr
why would they take that burden upon themselves when they can just put it on you
exactly
you’re one person entering the library they have to check hindewds 4/14/25, 8:55 PM - Poonam: drugs idk
hundreds
Just keep your bag outside and take your laptop/charger
You can always come out and bring something else if you forget
mouse notebook laptop laptop charger your pouch everything is such a hastle to take inside and then bring the same thing out agian
do your aec project washed
wasted
Literally a first world problem / skill issue 4/14/25, 8:56 PM - Poonam: Library is top 1 druggie spot
idc bro
bhai itna nahi ro sakte har chiz ke baare me
ain't nobody gonna change the rules for you m8 when everyone else complies
im not crying just asking what their reasons were
the system is there because it’s efficient, not because it’s the most fun 4/14/25, 8:56 PM - Poonam: agreed bro it's very annoying
Plus keeping bag and all will occupy tons of space in the library
Bro you have never been in the library
Like people do in the workspafe
yeah well no one is asking to change the rules 'm8'
Beef
Lsfgo
What’s the point of this rant then 😭😭
but a man can ask😔
idt that’s an issue, library is never crowded to that extent, it just makes the whole checking in checking out system very basic for the college
and a man can answer
I wanted to know what their reasons were 4/14/25, 8:57 PM - Poonam: library tspmo 4/14/25, 8:59 PM - Poonam: who tf reads books in 2025 bro just let us take the bag in 😭😭
this is why you can’t string together 3 sentences without brainrot
yeah this is another reason lol
Losing aura
So you don't fucking use the library like a workspace and hog it like a fat bastard
Woah 4/14/25, 9:00 PM - Poonam: how does me bringing my bag in turn it into a workspace 😡
Why go to library when dasa ws (guys pls come here its still cool and relevant)
Queen bee type shit
What
?😭😭😭😭
is reading a book impressive to you
My attention span ain't built for allat 4/14/25, 9:02 PM - Poonam: no it's satire 4/14/25, 9:02 PM - Poonam: real
Give me the subway surfers gameplay in the background and then we'll talk
gta v >
Or those minecraft parkour vids
Now that reminds me

Is sports attendance being counted if manual attendance is not marked?
Yes. In the mornings, only biometrics are taken afaik
Is lini teaching
Or gajjar

To see if the eigenvalues are real and >< 0 or not etc
Ok so technically that quadratic thing and that spectral thing is all he did since Quiz 2 innit

Nvm
This is after that
Thenk

Crazy how UG2 fucks us over multiple times this course lmao
UG2s are such lovely people.

No iss  class right
Go to class
Yes 4/16/25, 8:27 AM - Pratish 228: Yes
so we can just not give this one right?
Yes if you are sure you scored nicely in 1st quiz 4/16/25, 8:30 AM - Gautam 016: The attendance for the quizzes may add to the class attendance
ughhhh
what does one who hasn’t studied at all for this quiz do 😃 4/16/25, 8:31 AM - Gautam 016: I'm in the same situation 😔 4/16/25, 9:31 AM - Pratish 228: Wtf happened to Kadamb?
Cooked so hard the kitchen caught fire 4/16/25, 9:32 AM - Pratish 228: I just went and it was closed
The humble all nighter:
Yeah you now have been randomly reallocated to north or south for breakfast 4/16/25, 9:33 AM - Pratish 228: Oh
ug2 is suggesting we prepone iss to 30th
what do i say to them
is it something everyone will be ok with?
naaa obvioslyyy😭😭
is postponing their exam not feasible ?the one that was on Saturday for them
3rd is the last day of exams na :/
ok cool
People w ❌ can u give reasons? We don't have any paper on 30th
We'll get less time to study for ISS if it gets preponed
Will it make a difference
Yes it will obviously
It's a full day
But you will have more time to study cso
Cso has more credits than iss
CLD has an exam on 2nd
Essentially anyone who doesn't have CSO has some other exam
Didn't it get changed to 3rd?
can u send the tentative schedule if it gets changed
i didn't read everything in the cso group
We have exams on both 2nd and 3rd, but I don't get what problem that might cause
As of the last true update, our CL and CSO exams have swapped days
And CSO is in the morning
It doesn't change anything for you people if ISS gets shifted to 30th
We were wondering whether we could prepone ISS by a day, so that CGD doesn't have 3 back to back exams
So why are you objecting?
We are objecting?
Has the acad office not responded yet
To the prev mail
Not u
so it'll be   ISS 30th break 31st CSO 1st CL 2nd  @919941637224 is this right
if iss is prepjjnded
preponed
? How
Sorry mb
Wait
It'll be 2nd CSO and 3rd C
L
🍿
DSA – 26th April – 3-6  LA – 28th April – 9-12  IoT – 29th April – 3-6  ISS – 30th April 
If iss gets preponed
Cso is now on 2nd
This means csx will have 3 back to back exams
Wdym b2b? How?
Exactly
THAT'S NOT FUCKING BACK TO BABK
oh right
having exam on the next day istn back to back
I meant back to back days mb
BACK TO BACK IS WHEN YOU HAVE TWO PAPERS ON ONE DAY AND ANOTHER PAPER ON THE MORNING OF THE VERY NEXR DAY
I explained to him irl, dw
yeah break before cso would be better than before iss I'm fine with preponing it
He won't make this mistake _again_
You can't avoid that when you have these many exams and less days
But having 2exams 1day break and then 2exams is better than having 3 exams 1day break and 1exam
we have 3 exams with 0 break now lmao
just to be clear this is assuming that cso is on the 2nd (no switchback)
Then sadly u don't have a choice to change that. If you have pls exercise it.
if we are doing iss on 30th can we please ask for the 3 - 6 shift
the morning shift will mean that we have iss just after iot
Imagine trying to help your batchmates
Cld guys do you have anyexam on 29th ?
Couldn't be you @918807494038
Bruh
ITL from 3-6
ok so i talked to acads office, they will revert cso and cl-1
they were extremely mad at everyone involved and they were yelling at me for it lmao
NICE
honestly if no other branch has takleef , then keep the original schedule
no changes at all
write this in the cso group na
let the mail come
Amazing
okayy
they were genuinely mad at me tho, they said they wont consider any exam shifting requests in the future
we will need to see how serious they are about that
isn't it their fault for keeping 2 core courses on the same day in the first place?
why they mad at you for? spill convo
Did ISS prepone??
Or ISS still on 1st May??
no
Will tut quiz attendance be counted??
yes 4/16/25, 11:48 AM - +91 7397 498 522: Are the room allocations correct? There seems to be a UG2 class in SH3 w Tapan Sau in there
0_0 4/16/25, 11:55 AM - +91 7397 498 522: Indranil fixing 🙏🙏🙏
okay cool 4/16/25, 12:49 PM - Gautam 016: Is there kadamb biryani today?
Nope 4/16/25, 1:00 PM - Gautam 016: Ya got to know on the portal, I have north 😔
Man these aren't math courses anymore
This was so bad
Its a sad day for us 😔😔
Why are they mad at YOU if THEY fucked up
Avg over-ego of iiit incharges
i love that not a single senior has typed anything on the cso group
they all shut the fuck up
because academics office
no they saw academic secretary in the mail and complained to their batch mps... thing is only one of them is actually active and he's sensible lol
i’m not saying they did nothing, but group mei jo aukaat dikha rahe the
haa true lmao
it was a really big scheduling L from the acads office, and an even bigger L from ug2 on how they handled it
it was so simple all they had to do was suggest alternatives to us instead of acads office... cld even agreed to a swap for them
but noo they went directly thinking only about themselves and now acads office is mad at everyone and they didnt get what they wanted either
Acads office ew
Hate them and almost everyone who works there :<
Anshul <3
anshul is mp?
yes
The ISS labs are the best 8 out of 10 right?
Yes
damn
but theres been 12
1 and 10 are ungraded
11 mb yes
wait no
ah i see
10 only
wait what
10 only
yeah
11 was numpy na
*
pygame
that was graded
yep
anyone wants to team up in ISS 🥺 (u will work, not me)
is anyone in iss lab short a team member 😃
chat has anyone found 30
were stuck on 23
Tf is happening in FG?
Oh Farewell
Is sports attendance on ims correct. Cuz it's much lesser than the real one for me
marathon and republic day isn’t added
add 2 for republic day and 3/6 for marathon
1 for republic day is already added I think
I think so*
If I add this, then it is correct
Incorrect for me
that’s why i said 2
republic day is 3
I asked nagaraju yesterday, there's a difference of around 9-10 attendances between ims and the actual
not that i remember? 4/16/25, 5:17 PM - Devansh 211: Same bhai
not for everyone
No, marathon hasn't been added
Just this is added i guess
yes
For me it's 5 attendance diff
At least not as of the last time attendance was charted
Yeah but better to directly confirm
Worst case scenario, if we fall short by 1 attendance, will he fail us
Idts
beg
Is it 34 or 32
32
32 for girls, 34 for boys
no
Right?
32 and 30
I mean last sem he let people with 28-29 attendance pass
Wait realllyyyy?!
i asked nagaraju earlier this sem
Oh damn
100% sure na?
it’s nagaraju so take it with a grain of salt
😭
i asked him how many i need this sem is it 34 and he said no 32
Can someone who's going to sports today ask him again pls
I don't have a slot now
since when do they check 😭
They do manual sometimes na
wtf
yeah and they mark it anyways
the football coach does atleast
Oh
case to case
i think his specifically is 10
Martial arts once he said no. So didn't try
which makes sense maybe 6 for marathon 2 for republic and then error of 2
still
thats a lot
Yeah for me it was😔I was faltu mein worried
:(
yeah football sir is chill af
Pls someone going today do this
Everyone looks chill unless he tells u to come at 6 45
530 slot idk 645 they never care
they’re too tired by that point
Imagine not having YOGA
I hate yoga tho 💀
He's saying 32 for girls
But saying "Daily aa jao"
And for the rest of us?
raining
34 for boys
34
:/
Daily as in evening?
wait werent we supposed to get a mail for kadamb dinner?
Mails were sent around 2 PM
mb i missed it
thats too short of a timeframe though, especially when we were in lab
we did
and we weren't told when the form would come out either
yeah i just saw
eatclub has buy one get one on pizza today
we sent it via email to those registered for kadamba
yeah i wanted to cancel meal 😔

Where is all 300?
Section B says hi
Me too
And that's fine by me honestly
the hari aakash option
Zope Ima touch u violently next time I see you
This poll is not correct though, having three 250s > having 1 300 + 2 200s
Make a new poll with ranges of 50 and total marks going till 300 if you want proper data
POLL: What is your DSA Graded Lab average at atm OPTION: 200-300 (11 votes) OPTION: 100-200 (22 votes) OPTION: 50-100 (3 votes) OPTION: 💔 (18 votes)

I mean if we all sleep together the night before then we can wake up and all start crying together more efficiently
Good cryday* 4/17/25, 1:20 PM - Gautam 016: Can't sleep together with clothes on in this summer
Invite me as chief guest, special experienced speaker... and I might consider your offer inexchange of 7.4 sports attandances
For consistency one shdve included "before 33% increase" or wtever
Do a poll after today's GL with precise details
and smaller interval
we have best 3 out of 5 labs right
Okay
Even better
make sure y'all are averging with post-33% increase cuz that's finally what will be considered
Wait for the poll after GL
okey
Did you create a zip bomb or sumtin
its a normal code I don't even know that it could do that
Infinite loop it seems
Has the seating arrangement been sent out yet?
No
does this imply that the dsa graded lab has been cancelled👉👈
idk the code works for the first test case and any other general testcase
@mps who is Dean academics and should I go to meet if he's left me on "applied" for medical leave since 2 weeks

dean.academics@iiit.ac.in

Hey everyone,  The *Clubs Council introductory session* is starting in just half an hour! We understand that some recent emails have raised questions about the policies and functioning of the student body — and this session is the right space to understand the structure, our roles, and the work we do.  If you're genuinely curious about how things actually work, what goes on behind the scenes, or if you have any questions you'd like to ask — this is the perfect opportunity.  We’ll be starting sharp at 9:30 PM at H103. Hope to see you there!

thought i can get free attendance today 😢 4/18/25, 5:00 PM - Gautam 016: What about yoga? Was it there in the morning
Today is a holiday so no yoga no sports
Did anyone get full in 2.4, 2.5, 2.6? If yes what exactly did you write
2.4 yes
5, 6 don't ask
Yes
lmao did anyone get above 1.5 or 2 for using induction in 2.5 and 2.6
wait is paper showing still going on??

Yes
does anyone have an i2c module they're not using? if yes, could i please have it till monday 4/18/25, 10:21 PM - Hemang: Guys, please do NOT leave any food out for Tofu at obh circle. Dogs from other packs end up coming there for it and they trouble Tofu. If you want to feed anything to her (surely nothing too sweet/spicy/oily), do so only if you're staying with her while she eats it. Also: recently there was an incident of a dog accidentally consuming chocolate cake at BBC, because some group celebrating a bday just left the cake there after the celebration. Please be more careful with food around dogs.
do we have iss class tomorrow?
sec b
Yes
ok thx
With a class activity
what
😭
yalls iss isn't over?
Wallahi I wanted to sleep in class 😭
There have been a lot of cases where people have left a lot of stuff that dogs could consume (everything from paint during the wall painting, to diet coke just a few days ago). Please, if you notice that something like this has happened, please inform a CCC member asap, so that we can take action.
did anyone get batteries for their iot?
Yeah how are we supposed to power the esp32s? 💀
wall charger
power bank
is that allowed?
it’s what we were told to do
wont noor say power bank isnt an iot device
i see
and a wall plug is…?
will he say wall isnt
Unrelated foes anyone have a spare power bank
ha tho thats why i asked if anyone got battery no 😭
a better isn’t either…
Who keeps end evals after mid evals which was just like a week ago?
battery
iot tas
?
how is a battery an iot device
dunno
what else are we supposed to do 😭
What is an iot device now
Any sensor that they give that conveniently doesn't work
seeing this shit actually makes me like my term paper assignment
How does iiit manage to suck out all the fun from fun tinkering subjects
iiit 👍
Don't give parts at all or delay it till the end. Then the parts that they give finally don't work .
And then they'll dock points if we don't use each and every sensor that they gave
They atleast take a week to get new parts.
yeah atleast the papers I'm referring to will not suddenly stop working or disappear (i beg you JSTOR) hah I'll take my lowly human science degree thank you
are we expected to set up authentication and stuff for iiot project
Just use wikipedia citations like a chad 🦆
yeah the prof is definitely going to believe that I read and understood random German papers
Does section b have iss class tomorrow
yes 😔
we have another class activity right?
I mean, as long as our prof doesn't question how we learnt to code stuff that we're supposed to cover in the future rn for our project, we should be sitting pretty 😂
Yeah
You literally flattered him with your correct german pronounciations
I think there's a massive difference between using some new apis to yknow reading (and finding) fat papers in an entirely different language
remember kids, it only has to _sound_ correct
At least what you are doing is cool though :(

It's not difficult enough for him 😔
By the way, if any of you voted in the tantra poll and didn't see it voted now, I deleted your response as the poll was for students who are staying on campus during the summer break. So, it's not a bug. Though, if you find any bug in the parliament's site, feel free to report it or fix it yourself. Codebase is present at gitlab.iiit.ac.in/parliament/website
Hopefully there are no more bugs left, it took too much time to fix them
There are still bugs being found in the mess, pls fix
Ask to do something that is feasible

Idk i left there was a lot of smoke
why do you want that to happen
hope it doesnt, if it happens we'll see 0_0
we'll see what can be done
i dont want that to happen lmao, what measures can the mess comm or smtg take now to prevent the chances
Do none of us know whats causing the fires?
Surely someone must have noticed something before the conflagration today at South
investigations have not fully been completed, but the kadamba one was because a kadhai of hot oil was left to cool and something fell into it
south one was apparently a short circuit
🫡
College going to take this as a reason to shut another mess down temporarily lmao
they cant lmao it'll collapse the mess system
we are discussing that
Better that than have the ceiling collapse on top of someone 💀
