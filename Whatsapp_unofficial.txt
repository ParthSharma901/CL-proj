1/2/25, 12:09 PM - +91 74978 08993: Hey everyone!

Hope your first class (if it was there) was good.
I would like to clarify that the attendance will be counted from class 1 for all UG1 courses. So, make sure to attend all your classes from today only. *This is what I was told by the Academic Office.*

Also, all the cases of probation for UG1 have been resolved by the Academic Office. If you are on academic probation and have not been contacted by the Academic Office for the same, contact Academic Office in person at the earliest.

Also, for anyone, if your courses are not approved at IMS->Academics->My courses, approach any MP.
1/2/25, 12:09 PM - +91 74978 08993: Attend all your classes, try to keep a buffer, and don't approach if your attendance is below the required criterion at the end of semester.

Just a reminder about the inter-batch sports tournament. I hope you guys have registered for the same. If not, please register and participate in as many games as you can.

Also, you might have to re-register due to the Microsoft Migration Issues. Check the mail for more info.

Our batch can win the trophy for sure and now it's in your hands to make it happen. 

Best of luck and make us proud :)

Today's lab for G6-G10 will be conducted in TL1, TL2, and TL3 from 2-5 pm.
Professor Venkatesh Chopella will start the lab with an introduction to Python, followed by problem-solving by TAs.

We request that G1-G5/Non UG1 students with no classes or tut scheduled also join the meeting and attend as well. This will be supportive for you.

G6-G10 should present physically at TL1, TL2 and TL3. Attendance will be taken. Please bring your laptops

1/4/25, 12:29 PM - +91 80900 78449: <Media omitted>
1/4/25, 12:30 PM - +91 91314 11837: +1 for sure
1/4/25, 12:35 PM - +91 93276 89404: Daily meals yeah
1/4/25, 12:36 PM - +91 81253 19531: Hartal is NOT the solution bro
1/4/25, 12:36 PM - +91 81253 19531: If you do that the college will let you starve and die
1/4/25, 12:36 PM - +91 77098 45743: +1
1/4/25, 12:37 PM - +91 91314 11837: Propose a better idea then

1/4/25, 12:38 PM - +91 81253 19531: ~Burn the college~
1/4/25, 12:39 PM - +91 77098 45743: An easy system which we can suggest them to implement is choice of different meals all across the week in different messes. For example, choosing all breakfasts of the week in one mess, all lunches in another one, and similarly choose separately for all dinners in a week. This may not be as good as our previous system but far better than the present one. <This message was edited>
1/4/25, 12:40 PM - +91 99003 73186: This is a good idea
1/4/25, 1:02 PM - +91 93988 38711: Hack iiit site
1/4/25, 1:09 PM - +91 70193 18279: And option to save mess choice should also be there.
I don't want to login every 2 weeks and register for the messes.
Incase I forget to register, then problems happen.
1/4/25, 1:17 PM - +91 93267 77582: Yeah but also the previous one was just working fine though
1/4/25, 1:17 PM - +91 93267 77582: They only suddenly have issues with it after the frog lmao
1/4/25, 1:38 PM - +91 97080 76001: I am ready to do the protest any moment. We can ask them for flexibility of meal choices atleast. When do you want to do the protest? Monday?

1/4/25, 1:46 PM - +91 93445 29774: Quick question: what exactly does this protest entail?
1/4/25, 1:46 PM - +91 80900 78449: Good question ❓ @919708076001
1/4/25, 1:46 PM - +91 90394 77813: From our mutual understanding we arrive at ki galti se out dab gya tha
1/4/25, 1:46 PM - +91 80900 78449: <Media omitted>
1/4/25, 1:47 PM - +91 97080 76001: We can figure that out. Mainly it's about the flexibility of choosing our meals and meal cancellations. And to question if our opinions actually matter
1/4/25, 1:47 PM - +91 63541 09703: karna kya hai exactly?
1/4/25, 1:48 PM - +91 72044 30421: YAYYYY A PROOOTESTTTTT

1/4/25, 1:48 PM - +91 72044 30421: gaali allowed?
1/4/25, 1:48 PM - +91 93445 29774: The reason is pretty obvious, we are all enraged about that, but having a protest without any clear idea of what u r even doing is just kinda stupid
1/4/25, 1:48 PM - +91 97080 76001: No😂
1/4/25, 1:48 PM - +91 90394 77813: Are wo to must hai
1/4/25, 1:48 PM - +91 72044 30421: what about unkind and non polite words in english?

1/4/25, 1:49 PM - +91 97080 76001: We can think more till Monday, but what I thought is ki we will go to girish office and talk directly, asking for a confirmation as to when things will change
1/4/25, 1:50 PM - +91 90394 77813: Tu akela bhi to ja skta hai fir to 😂
1/4/25, 1:50 PM - +91 97080 76001: Upto you, cpro ka grading ke liye toh Dena chahiye
1/4/25, 1:50 PM - +91 76709 60227: Things will not change
1/4/25, 1:50 PM - +91 93445 29774: I'm pretty sure he's said that things will change once we can come up with our own website for mess registration
1/4/25, 1:50 PM - +91 97080 76001: If less people are there, he can easily send us back
1/4/25, 1:50 PM - +91 97080 76001: We can try still
1/4/25, 1:50 PM - +91 76709 60227: If there is no protest

1/4/25, 2:40 PM - +91 97080 76001: He still can revert back to the old system na till the time it doesn't change, that's what the senior mailed also right?
1/4/25, 2:40 PM - +91 97080 76001: Guide us sar
1/4/25, 2:48 PM - +91 93445 29774: Acc to him the old system required a lot of manual work and was too inconvenient for them to manage, and that's why he refuses to go back to the old system
1/4/25, 2:49 PM - +91 97080 76001: But that doesn't mean they will implement a system which no student is in favour of
1/4/25, 2:52 PM - +91 93445 29774: Well they just did, literally why everyone is enraged
1/4/25, 2:52 PM - +91 97080 76001: Doesn't seem to bother him though
1/4/25, 2:53 PM - +91 93445 29774: It doesn't affect him so he doesn't care
1/4/25, 2:54 PM - +91 97080 76001: That's what we have to do, we have to make sure he cares
1/4/25, 2:54 PM - +91 97080 76001: We can't compromise, not this time
1/4/25, 2:55 PM - +91 99967 48163: And how can we do that exactly
1/4/25, 2:55 PM - +91 93445 29774: Yes, that's the entire point
1/4/25, 2:55 PM - +91 93445 29774: This is literally why everyone is getting mad at him
1/4/25, 2:58 PM - +91 97080 76001: I mean if 50-60 people stand at his door, it would change something
1/4/25, 3:09 PM - +91 80782 07252: not even half of that number will show up
1/4/25, 3:10 PM - Krrish Gupta: ppl already started kassi-ing in workspace
1/4/25, 3:10 PM - +91 93445 29774: 🤫🧏
1/4/25, 3:23 PM - +91 97080 76001: People will, 50 is not a very tough number to gather I think
1/4/25, 4:26 PM - +91 76790 41770: We should train an LLM in this group chat (and see how much it scores in Autistic meter)
1/4/25, 4:28 PM - +91 98492 33901: this grp will be its ultimate training

1/5/25, 12:42 AM - +91 90049 84037: Q
1/5/25, 12:43 AM - +91 70759 70819: Is this the new E 🫴🦋?
1/5/25, 7:01 AM - +91 99416 37224: Naur, it's the new V
1/5/25, 10:28 AM - +91 89556 80330: <Media omitted>
1/5/25, 10:29 AM - +91 96633 60173: Why do I see two dots (.) in the mail ID
1/5/25, 10:29 AM - +91 96633 60173: Check that
1/5/25, 10:29 AM - +91 97271 18600: If we are not going to study DSA in python(as per the votings) would it be taught for the next two weeks or C++?
1/5/25, 10:31 AM - +91 96633 60173: I mean, python is gonna be anyway gonna be taught in ISS, might as well just study C++ in DSA. But idk what chopella will actually do
1/5/25, 10:33 AM - +91 89556 80330: It's 1 dot, and for some reasons after giving an error it automatically logged in
1/5/25, 10:33 AM - +91 96633 60173: Huh, interesting
1/5/25, 12:34 PM - +91 81253 19531: Does Girish not know how calendar works
1/5/25, 12:35 PM - +91 70327 21641: He likes to start and end his week with holidays
1/5/25, 12:36 PM - +91 70193 18279: I thought that they would give choice between python or c or c++ for each student and not for class as a whole. 
If so , I feel that it is best that every student has his own choice for all the languages
1/5/25, 12:36 PM - +91 63541 09703: Dasa ahh week
1/5/25, 12:36 PM - +91 81253 19531: I agree with THIS honestly
1/5/25, 12:38 PM - +91 93445 29774: Ehh I'd prefer it if it was the same language for everyone
1/5/25, 12:39 PM - +91 95134 60606: That's unrealistic 
They would have to design 3 separate courses to implement that system
1/5/25, 12:39 PM - +91 95134 60606: Also they wouldn't be able to teach OR grade at the same standard if that happened
1/5/25, 12:40 PM - +91 93445 29774: Plus in case of any discrepancy it'd be difficult for us to make arguments
1/5/25, 12:40 PM - +91 99416 37224: Imagine going to the lab exam, seeing that the questions need you to use a hash map, and spend 1 hour just coding out a proper hash map in C lol
The choice ought to just be C++/Py

1/6/25, 4:27 PM - +91 99416 37224: ISS doesn't have Tuts according to the course doc, but CSO does
1/6/25, 4:27 PM - +91 98492 33901: La also must have ig cuz tut quizzes are graded
1/6/25, 4:27 PM - +91 99416 37224: IOT doesn't have it either, according to the CSX Sem wise plan
1/6/25, 4:28 PM - +91 99416 37224: <Media omitted>
1/6/25, 4:34 PM - +91 72859 06873: thanks
1/6/25, 5:02 PM - +91 89776 33871: Does anyone know when is the qualification for the chess inter batch
1/6/25, 5:11 PM - +91 93988 38711: Is the IoT thing groupwise ??
1/6/25, 6:01 PM - +91 72859 06873: labs and project are
1/6/25, 6:13 PM - +91 63541 09703: Literally said no
1/6/25, 6:13 PM - +91 63541 09703: 💀💀

1/6/25, 6:13 PM - +91 72859 06873: oh wait shit i thought they mean teams sorry
1/6/25, 6:14 PM - +91 63541 09703: Cool cool
1/6/25, 6:14 PM - +91 99003 73186: From what I've heard we must conduct the selection ourselves
1/6/25, 6:15 PM - +91 99003 73186: 4 ppl represent the batch
1/6/25, 6:15 PM - +91 99003 73186: So we"ll prolly hold a lichess event and top 4 get selected
1/6/25, 6:24 PM - +91 99100 97808: i mean don't they have to provide info regarding who all registered etc
1/6/25, 6:27 PM - +91 99003 73186: Alr i just asked a ug2 senior to see how they doing it. But i presumed we'd like create a WhatsApp grp regarding the selections  and those who registered wld join the whats app group
1/6/25, 7:45 PM - +91 93529 00820: Any update on whether we'll continue doing dsa in python or change?
1/6/25, 7:55 PM - +91 81253 19531: Asked a TA he said they've been instructed to teach in Python for now
1/6/25, 7:59 PM - +91 99003 73186: Ya he replied saying we cld do it that way, so one of us wld need to create a grp for this soon
1/6/25, 8:01 PM - +91 93529 00820: What about the poll then?
1/6/25, 8:02 PM - +91 99967 48163: Do u think these guys will change the language just because the majority wants that
1/6/25, 8:02 PM - +91 91005 97546: u may never know, there's no wrong in trying too.(depends on their mood)
1/6/25, 8:03 PM - +91 88074 94038: Why did they change to python
1/6/25, 8:03 PM - +91 99967 48163: Cause in C you have to write everything from scratch...python has some shortcuts
1/6/25, 8:03 PM - +91 93445 29774: Python very cool language
1/6/25, 8:04 PM - +91 93529 00820: I am just asking.
Ta's are instructed we know that too. But they must have done the poll after thinking something na
1/6/25, 8:04 PM - +91 99967 48163: 😶
1/6/25, 8:04 PM - +91 93445 29774: 🙃
1/6/25, 8:08 PM - +91 98492 33901: C++ also does
1/6/25, 8:08 PM - +91 98492 33901: So why not C++
1/6/25, 8:09 PM - +91 70193 18279: python is a more widely used language and it is in general important to know python ig. Thus this is a way of making us more comfortable and learn python better.
1/6/25, 8:09 PM - +91 93445 29774: Dude you touched python for 10 minutes and decided you didn't like it
1/6/25, 8:09 PM - +91 91005 97546: Yesss
1/6/25, 8:09 PM - +91 98492 33901: I didn't say I don't like
1/6/25, 8:10 PM - +91 98492 33901: I said c++ is much more convenient
1/6/25, 8:10 PM - +91 98492 33901: With all the data structures and stl
1/6/25, 8:10 PM - +91 93445 29774: Same point, u haven't even tried python yet
1/6/25, 8:10 PM - +91 98492 33901: Did
1/6/25, 8:10 PM - +91 98492 33901: It's good only I'm not saying it's bad
1/6/25, 8:11 PM - +91 93445 29774: Lite then
1/6/25, 8:11 PM - +91 98492 33901: Also anyways we r learning python in iss, so why again?
1/6/25, 8:11 PM - +91 98492 33901: I'm ok with anything
1/6/25, 8:11 PM - +91 93445 29774: Ofc u r
1/6/25, 8:11 PM - +91 98492 33901: Just prefer c++
1/6/25, 8:12 PM - +91 91759 77518: why is python preferred by the python voters though
1/6/25, 8:12 PM - +91 93445 29774: Idk why just went on vibes
1/6/25, 8:12 PM - +91 91759 77518: 🙄
1/6/25, 8:12 PM - +91 70193 18279: it is in general more widely used for lot of purposes, so better if you get more comfortable with it.
1/6/25, 8:13 PM - +91 91759 77518: but this stands
1/6/25, 8:14 PM - +91 70193 18279: ya, but more practice the better.
Acc to me, it won't make much of a diff if you use python or c++.
But c will be much more of a headache than these two
1/6/25, 8:14 PM - +91 74978 08993: Language doesn't matter, get hold of core concepts and you can learn as many languages as you want
1/6/25, 8:15 PM - +91 98492 33901: In c we need to create all the data structures from scratch
1/6/25, 8:15 PM - +91 98492 33901: That's one problem cuz it's a low level language
1/6/25, 8:15 PM - +91 70193 18279: major pain point is not having something like dynamic arrays(lists in python or vectors in cpp)
1/6/25, 8:15 PM - +91 98492 33901: Ya
1/6/25, 8:16 PM - +91 98492 33901: True for dsa as long as u can get the pseudo code and algo correct, ig lang doesn't matter
1/6/25, 8:17 PM - +91 98492 33901: It's just a matter of conveniencr
1/6/25, 8:17 PM - +91 79763 44711: language matters for lab exams
1/6/25, 8:17 PM - +91 79763 44711: paper exams lite pseudo works
1/6/25, 8:17 PM - +91 93445 29774: So you're saying I can speak any language? Waow
1/6/25, 8:17 PM - +91 79763 44711: not in lab tho
1/6/25, 8:17 PM - +91 98492 33901: For labs yes
1/6/25, 8:17 PM - +91 70193 18279: yes but in c , ull break ur head more about unwanted stuff than the dsa concepts many times, so python or c++ will be better in those aspects
1/6/25, 8:17 PM - +91 79763 44711: that’s 40% of our grade bro 😭
1/6/25, 8:17 PM - +91 98492 33901: Yup
1/6/25, 8:17 PM - +91 98492 33901: I never said c is better tho
1/6/25, 8:18 PM - +91 74978 08993: It matters, but everyone's gonna have the same time and same amount of code to write
1/6/25, 8:18 PM - +91 98492 33901: C is the worst choice for dsa
1/6/25, 8:18 PM - +91 98492 33901: Imo
1/6/25, 8:19 PM - +91 74978 08993: So, if it's relative grading, I don't think language matters a lot unless you have a hold of core concepts.
1/6/25, 8:19 PM - +91 93445 29774: Who the fuck is talking abt c
1/6/25, 8:19 PM - +91 93445 29774: Irrelevant ahh language
1/6/25, 8:21 PM - +91 98492 33901: So the current majority is cpp but again does it depend on the prof?
1/6/25, 8:21 PM - +91 98492 33901: Our snrs apparently had in cpp
1/6/25, 8:21 PM - +91 98492 33901: And also it's the industry standard
1/6/25, 8:22 PM - +91 98492 33901: Ofc java has more pref for dsa
1/6/25, 8:22 PM - +91 80782 07252: no they had in c
1/6/25, 8:22 PM - +91 70193 18279: acc to what TAs told in tdy's tut, Chopella will keep it in python only mostly and it is doubtfull that he will change anything in his plan
1/6/25, 8:22 PM - +91 98492 33901: Did they?
1/6/25, 8:23 PM - +91 98492 33901: I think it was c and then a gradual shift to cpp
1/6/25, 8:23 PM - +91 98492 33901: Idk
1/6/25, 8:23 PM - +91 99003 73186: I remember soumil saying dsa is taught in c
1/6/25, 8:23 PM - +91 98492 33901: Ohh
1/6/25, 8:35 PM - +91 72859 06873: learning how to implement a hash map is not "unwanted stuff ull break ur head about"
1/6/25, 8:35 PM - +91 72859 06873: but ok
1/6/25, 8:35 PM - +91 72859 06873: the entire point of dsa is to learn how to implement the data structures, so why use a language that has the data structures built in 😭
1/6/25, 8:36 PM - +91 93445 29774: Advait built different
1/6/25, 8:36 PM - +91 63541 09703: But like who in actual power gonna read all this and tryna change so f it and move on😎 <This message was edited>

A bulb simply exploded in the new dining area in the guest house just before dinner timings n there was like, smoke and shattered glass everywhere. Luckily very few students(including me) were present at the time of the incident.
At this point Kadamb's just unlucky lmao

Cpp is better for dsa

1/10/25, 3:48 PM - +91 93445 29774: He takes half of our lab time to "teach" some random shit that has absolutely nothing to do with what we're actually learning in dsa and then the he gives us the remaining measly time left to operate on whatever bs he's given us
1/10/25, 3:53 PM - +91 96633 60173: Why tf are we being taught functional programming in DSA😭
1/10/25, 3:53 PM - +91 96633 60173: No one does this shit in the real world.

1/10/25, 3:59 PM - +91 77450 90290: we have to change it

1/10/25, 4:11 PM - +91 96633 60173: Ya, its functional programming, loops not allowed 😭
1/10/25, 4:11 PM - +91 70759 70819: Only functions
1/10/25, 4:11 PM - +91 70759 70819: And the functions also can't have loops :)

1/10/25, 8:09 PM - +91 70759 70819: One file for fibonacci, one file for bubblesort and put both those folders in one zipped folder
1/10/25, 8:10 PM - +91 80782 07252: :0 what the
1/10/25, 8:10 PM - +91 80782 07252: Not two zipped files?
1/10/25, 8:10 PM - +91 74283 51400: What about the IoT lab report?
1/10/25, 8:11 PM - +91 70759 70819: No
1/10/25, 8:12 PM - +91 74978 08993: Whole zipped folder, no?
1/10/25, 8:12 PM - +91 74978 08993: How will those two files work on their own?
1/10/25, 8:13 PM - +91 74978 08993: Though, submit any, either whole folder or those two files, I think it should not be an issue
1/10/25, 8:14 PM - +91 99893 97880: I submitted the entire folder
1/10/25, 8:25 PM - +91 99416 37224: Same here

1/10/25, 9:07 PM - +91 76790 41770: but whatever lord chopped taught us today, is important for gamedev, and is a popular style of writing clean code. so 8/10 syllabus.
1/10/25, 9:08 PM - +91 76790 41770: As for how well he taught it. Just admit it guys, yall had laptops open and didn't even listen to him. He did go over all the logic and code line by line

1/10/25, 9:09 PM - +91 93445 29774: Guys I don't think he's being sarcastic
1/10/25, 9:09 PM - +91 89189 66044: Did not listen coz i was  wondering if i entered the wrong class <This message was edited>
1/10/25, 9:09 PM - +91 76790 41770: yea 😐, unbiased I listened to the class
1/10/25, 9:09 PM - +91 70193 18279: But it is not data structures and algorithms. 
This is like false advertising. 
Saying that ull teach DSA and finally teach Functional programming.
1/10/25, 9:10 PM - +91 93445 29774: I didn't listen coz I didn't feel like learning ds again
1/10/25, 9:11 PM - +91 76790 41770: True, he went too much industry heavy.

but that doesn't mean python is not a very good language for DSA
1/10/25, 9:11 PM - +91 76790 41770: atleast 'learning' and writing 'exam' part
1/10/25, 9:11 PM - +91 99100 97808: see this is when a mass batch email spam is needed
1/10/25, 9:12 PM - +91 93445 29774: This isn't about python, it's about how much what he's teaching deviates from what we are actually learning in dsa
1/10/25, 9:12 PM - +91 77450 90290: language is a moot point now that he's not even teaching dsa lmao
1/10/25, 9:12 PM - +91 76790 41770: not really, we will need this style of coding to understand some stuff
1/10/25, 9:12 PM - +91 70193 18279: Yes dsa can be learnt in any language. Im not complaining Abt that. 
I actually prefer python itself.
1/10/25, 9:13 PM - +91 99100 97808: but its completely irrelevant to anything in DSA
1/10/25, 9:13 PM - +91 93445 29774: He's just teaching his own shit
1/10/25, 9:13 PM - +91 99100 97808: he should teach the course hes supposed to teach
1/10/25, 9:13 PM - +91 99100 97808: not what he wants to teach
1/10/25, 9:13 PM - +91 70193 18279: There is a dedicated course for this ig.
1/10/25, 9:13 PM - +91 93445 29774: First of all, the purpose of labs is to apply what we have learnt in class
1/10/25, 9:13 PM - +91 99100 97808: yeah
1/10/25, 9:14 PM - +91 93445 29774: This guy is taking his own classes at the expense of doing actual lab time
1/10/25, 9:14 PM - +91 99100 97808: agreed, theres a complete disconnect between whats being done in class
1/10/25, 9:14 PM - +91 99100 97808: and what he chooses to teach
1/10/25, 9:14 PM - +91 93445 29774: And then we're supposed to do it on the spot
1/10/25, 9:14 PM - +91 93445 29774: In 2 fucking hours
1/10/25, 9:14 PM - +91 99100 97808: the whole point of DSA is taking a basic algorithm and using it in various contexts for solving different problems
1/10/25, 9:15 PM - +91 76790 41770: Guys guys, If we don't look at DSA without understanding State machienes. We will develop a bad way of writing code.

For a company, this skill is very useful to maintain a code and update it. this class was important and relevant to DSA
1/10/25, 9:15 PM - +91 99100 97808: in this its taking various problems and using it to create a basic algorith
1/10/25, 9:15 PM - +91 99100 97808: m
1/10/25, 9:15 PM - +91 93445 29774: Given that extensions will decrease our grade, this is even more bs
1/10/25, 9:15 PM - +91 77450 90290: not even 2, the tas themselves got to know what we have to do at around 415
lab officially ends at 5
1/10/25, 9:15 PM - +91 99003 73186: Ohh kk
1/10/25, 9:15 PM - +91 99100 97808: the thing is not everyone wants to do software engineering im sure ece+other research branches
1/10/25, 9:15 PM - +91 89189 66044: Its like telling we need to learn system design first then move our heads to learn oops
1/10/25, 9:16 PM - +91 77450 90290: sir
ppl dont know how to read python syntax
you are trying to teach an illiterate person shakespeare
1/10/25, 9:16 PM - +91 93445 29774: Yeah, even the fucking tas have no idea what's going on, how can we be expected to do this shit
1/10/25, 9:16 PM - +91 76790 41770: Then that's the problem, so tell sir to give us more basic practice problems as "hw" assignments
1/10/25, 9:16 PM - +91 95156 00307: I know it's ungraded but why does the due time say 530 and not 10/1030 like sir was saying??
1/10/25, 9:17 PM - +91 96638 76697: This message was deleted
1/10/25, 9:17 PM - +91 93445 29774: Even if it is important, overloading us with it from the get go and deviating from our actual dsa syllabus is a huge no no
1/10/25, 9:17 PM - +91 77450 90290: because its an unofficial extension
and you can still upload till 1030
1/10/25, 9:17 PM - +91 99100 97808: then whats the point of the lab
1/10/25, 9:17 PM - +91 95156 00307: Okay cool
1/10/25, 9:18 PM - +91 77450 90290: lini ma'am said the labs will mirror the lectures
this bs is absolutely not what labs are for
1/10/25, 9:18 PM - +91 99100 97808: i didn't attend the lab obv but i saw the line "from loop import loop" and thats the craziest thing ive ever seen
1/10/25, 9:18 PM - +91 93445 29774: It's like we're just learning a separate topic apart from dsa
1/10/25, 9:18 PM - +91 77450 90290: we are
1/10/25, 9:18 PM - +91 93563 51244: But all things apart the ideology insanely cool
1/10/25, 9:18 PM - +91 74978 08993: The class was relevant and important, but it should have been a part of the Cpro course rather than DSA
1/10/25, 9:18 PM - +91 99100 97808: but wrong course
1/10/25, 9:18 PM - +91 70193 18279: Probably this is only fr around first few labs only. 
After that it'll be dsa itself mostly ig
1/10/25, 9:18 PM - +91 99100 97808: its kind of like Abhishek teaching topology in RA
1/10/25, 9:18 PM - +91 99100 97808: he wasn't supposed to
1/10/25, 9:19 PM - +91 77450 90290: wrong course bru
1/10/25, 9:19 PM - +91 99100 97808: and it was definetly very cool
1/10/25, 9:19 PM - +91 99100 97808: but its the wrong course
1/10/25, 9:19 PM - +91 93563 51244: Ik t_t
1/10/25, 9:19 PM - +91 93563 51244: I like how he covered up by saying
1/10/25, 9:19 PM - +91 70193 18279: Wrong institute
1/10/25, 9:19 PM - +91 93563 51244: I and X are data structures
1/10/25, 9:19 PM - +91 76790 41770: Bro only got a few labs, and it's ungraded, so ig where chopped is coming from.

But yea it is unfair to those who don't know basics of python
1/10/25, 9:19 PM - +91 93563 51244: Btw @919941637224 what did you ask him
1/10/25, 9:20 PM - +91 78239 94065: bro understanding state machines and doing functional programming prolly have entire courses dedicated to them in the future...why are we doing this in dsa??
1/10/25, 9:20 PM - +91 74978 08993: Yahan CPro mein DSA tha, aur ab DSA mein Cpro and ISS h, all courses getting mixed
1/10/25, 9:20 PM - +91 93445 29774: Ok and? It still doesn't explain or excuse why he's doing all this shit
1/10/25, 9:20 PM - +91 77450 90290: which is _most_ of the batch
1/10/25, 9:20 PM - +91 70193 18279: He should have taught that in CMI or something, 
There is no course in IIIT where topology is there ig <This message was edited>
1/10/25, 9:20 PM - +91 99100 97808: forget basics of python it feels completely arbitrary

also isn't the next sem course automata theory literally for teaching finite state machines?
1/10/25, 9:20 PM - +91 77450 90290: you cant think of yourself only ffs
1/10/25, 9:20 PM - +91 99100 97808: real

1/10/25, 9:32 PM - +91 98492 33901: I have no problems with dsa in python
1/10/25, 9:32 PM - +91 98492 33901: Just a personal preference on cpp
1/10/25, 9:32 PM - +91 93445 29774: For all the "I'm ok with python" you spout all the time you seem to have an incredibly strong aversion to and hate for python
1/10/25, 9:34 PM - +91 98492 33901: Whatever u think of it bro
1/10/25, 9:35 PM - +91 93445 29774: It's not whatever I think of it, you keep finding a reason to shit on python, move on lil bro
1/10/25, 9:48 PM - +91 98492 33901: I literally said I have no problems with python
1/10/25, 9:48 PM - +91 98492 33901: the main problem is chopped

1/10/25, 10:36 PM - +91 96772 32382: Btw guys, Programming Club is conducting LockOut which is basically a 1v1 CP duel. 
So for one round, there would basically be a bunch of problems picked with different points for each of them and the two players race to solve them. Say one of them solves a problem, he gets the points for that problem and it gets locked for others. So the other player is screwed even if they are like one minute away from solving it. So yeah, it is really fun lmao(or maybe not if you are in the receiving end 💀). Lot of strategy involved on how to screw over your opponent.
There is a separate track for UG1, so ez W. Insane flex fr. Some of the later rounds _may_ even be streamed with commentary. Link to register: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUZzPPKjOab1ClVvADmHeGZQegE19X98VdSKm0hJUg5RutAw/viewform?usp=header

1/12/25, 10:49 AM - +91 99100 97808: @MPs we said C++ not python
1/12/25, 10:49 AM - +91 99100 97808: NOT C NOT PYTHON
1/12/25, 10:49 AM - +91 99100 97808: 😭😭
1/12/25, 10:49 AM - +91 98714 31209: it got deleted lite

1/12/25, 10:50 AM - +91 78508 72190: Better than python atleast na💀
1/12/25, 10:50 AM - +91 90496 99163: waitt whattt ??
1/12/25, 10:50 AM - +91 99893 97880: Actually
1/12/25, 10:50 AM - +91 98714 31209: c is better
1/12/25, 10:50 AM - +91 93988 38711: C++
1/12/25, 10:51 AM - +91 99808 30164: as long as it isn't python-
1/12/25, 10:51 AM - +91 81143 91950: what happened
1/12/25, 10:51 AM - +91 97779 11274: C++ is better
1/12/25, 10:51 AM - +91 98714 31209: osn is 4k lines of code in c
1/12/25, 10:51 AM - +91 93988 38711: Seniors had to BEG to gujjar for C++
1/12/25, 10:51 AM - Krrish Gupta: Bhai python se better toh C hi hai na
1/12/25, 10:51 AM - +91 98714 31209: c better
1/12/25, 10:51 AM - +91 78508 72190: Check announcements grp <This message was edited>
1/12/25, 10:52 AM - +91 99893 97880: Yayyyy it's C!!! <This message was edited>
1/12/25, 10:52 AM - +91 81868 67789: But with that, you can't learn to create data structures
1/12/25, 10:52 AM - +91 70327 21641: Lmaooo
1/12/25, 10:52 AM - +91 93267 77582: What the fuck
1/12/25, 10:52 AM - +91 93267 77582: Why would you agree to this
1/12/25, 10:52 AM - +91 70327 21641: These guys are crazy
1/12/25, 10:52 AM - +91 70327 21641: Watch them change their mind a week later
1/12/25, 10:52 AM - +91 93988 38711: so what about labs being in python and ungraded?
1/12/25, 10:52 AM - +91 70327 21641: Istg
1/12/25, 10:52 AM - +91 98714 31209: bro is the clg insane
1/12/25, 10:52 AM - +91 98405 80218: Real
1/12/25, 10:52 AM - +91 98714 31209: now next week it will be rust
1/12/25, 10:53 AM - +91 81868 67789: Will these 4 weeks be python or C
1/12/25, 10:55 AM - +91 98492 33901: Why C
1/12/25, 10:56 AM - +91 98492 33901: It's too tough to manage data structures
1/12/25, 10:56 AM - +91 98492 33901: And the next will be java lol
1/12/25, 10:56 AM - +91 98492 33901: And then javascript
1/12/25, 10:56 AM - +91 81868 67789: HTML
1/12/25, 10:56 AM - +91 98714 31209: dont forget css
1/12/25, 10:56 AM - +91 90919 29888: yes yes, data structures using html
1/12/25, 10:56 AM - +91 81868 67789: Better than python tho
1/12/25, 10:57 AM - +91 98492 33901: Profs be like
Why can't u do dsa in css
1/12/25, 10:57 AM - +91 77450 90290: ppls i really think this change is good
1/12/25, 10:57 AM - +91 77450 90290: and i don't think the profs are goign to change it erlang
1/12/25, 10:57 AM - +91 77450 90290: so chill about that
1/12/25, 10:58 AM - +91 98492 33901: Anyways our seniors too had it in c
1/12/25, 10:58 AM - +91 77450 90290: the labs will no longer be the mess that they were on friday
1/12/25, 10:58 AM - +91 93988 38711: change from C to python or python to C?
1/12/25, 10:58 AM - +91 98492 33901: So it's fair
1/12/25, 10:58 AM - +91 98405 80218: <Media omitted>
1/12/25, 10:58 AM - +91 78239 94065: do we still have to do functional programming or can we do normal programming
1/12/25, 10:58 AM - +91 77450 90290: normal programming
1/12/25, 10:58 AM - +91 78239 94065: thx
1/12/25, 10:58 AM - +91 77450 90290: dont think they'll do that
1/12/25, 10:58 AM - +91 93986 23088: Does we have lab on python or c..? <This message was edited>
1/12/25, 10:58 AM - +91 93988 38711: Yeah until they had to beg for C++
1/12/25, 10:58 AM - Kartik: Thanks to all the mps tho👍🏻
1/12/25, 10:58 AM - +91 98492 33901: Let's beg 😂 <This message was edited>
1/12/25, 10:59 AM - +91 93988 38711: uhh which change former to latter or the other way
1/12/25, 10:59 AM - +91 77450 90290: see the seniors had their labs in c, and towards the end for the difficult part with graphs and all, they let them use cpp
1/12/25, 10:59 AM - +91 77450 90290: so we can ask for the same
1/12/25, 10:59 AM - +91 81868 67789: My salute for those 26 members who selected python
1/12/25, 10:59 AM - +91 98714 31209: vedant so the conclusion is there is no other lang only c like last years right no confusion between c c++ python right
1/12/25, 10:59 AM - +91 70932 00799: Changed to C
1/12/25, 10:59 AM - +91 77450 90290: they are shifting back to C is what the prof told us
so no i dont think they'll change it
1/12/25, 11:00 AM - Eashaan Thakur: 😯
1/12/25, 11:00 AM - +91 98492 33901: So we will have to write code for maps, linked lists and stacks from scratch now
1/12/25, 11:00 AM - +91 90271 07284: <Media omitted>
1/12/25, 11:01 AM - +91 98492 33901: Anyways tq mps
1/12/25, 11:02 AM - +91 77450 90290: @917483618341 lmao
1/12/25, 11:03 AM - +91 74836 18341: <Media omitted>
1/12/25, 11:03 AM - +91 98492 33901: Next step
Dsa on bash
1/12/25, 11:04 AM - +91 96633 60173: Thank god, fuck functional programming
1/12/25, 11:04 AM - +91 96633 60173: No offense @917483618341
1/12/25, 11:09 AM - +91 99416 37224: The students: Can we please have C++ instead of Python uwu
The TAs, Profs (and the MPs? Idk): Fuck y'all, let's C <This message was edited>
1/12/25, 11:09 AM - +91 99416 37224: Let's C another batch bite the dust
1/12/25, 11:10 AM - +91 73372 95535: DSA is going to be much harder if we have to do it in C, please go with python or C++ @mps
1/12/25, 11:11 AM - +91 99416 37224: Why did you guys agree on C anyways @mps? Didn't the poll clearly say that the second most preferred option was Python?
1/12/25, 11:11 AM - +91 73372 95535: yes exactly^^
1/12/25, 11:14 AM - +91 99416 37224: While I understand that you couldn't have held another referendum to see if people wanted C or Python, the least you could have done is base your decisions off the previous one? What is the reasoning behind choosing C?
1/12/25, 11:15 AM - +91 99416 37224: Most colleges these days don't even have a "C Pro" course, let alone teach DSA in C
1/12/25, 11:15 AM - +91 77450 90290: which colleges are you referring to lmao
1/12/25, 11:16 AM - +91 77450 90290: we didn't choose lol
its mighty presumptious of you to assume we waltzed into someone's office and chose C
1/12/25, 11:16 AM - +91 99416 37224: Check out MITs lecs 
And apparently Princeton did it in Java? Am I not right @917075970819 ?
Or closer home, colleges like VIT (with whom we are sadly compared with) do follow the same
1/12/25, 11:16 AM - +91 99416 37224: You didn't choose, but your message sounds like we ought to be happy with this turn of events
1/12/25, 11:17 AM - +91 99416 37224: And that you guys aren't going to push against C
1/12/25, 11:17 AM - +91 77450 90290: so you want to do it in java? be my guest, walk into the deans office and demand it lmao
1/12/25, 11:17 AM - +91 73372 95535: Yeah
1/12/25, 11:17 AM - +91 73372 95535: The batch wanted C++ not C
1/12/25, 11:17 AM - +91 99416 37224: The batch wanted it in C++ lmao
Or if nothing, then Py
1/12/25, 11:17 AM - +91 99416 37224: Certainly not C 💀
1/12/25, 11:17 AM - +91 83686 09506: should have gone to vit 😔
1/12/25, 11:18 AM - +91 99416 37224: The batch does not want to C C
1/12/25, 11:18 AM - +91 70759 70819: Don't drag me into this -_-
1/12/25, 11:18 AM - +91 99416 37224: Ikr, that was my very next option 💀
1/12/25, 11:18 AM - +91 77450 90290: i am well aware what the batch wanted
1/12/25, 11:18 AM - +91 77450 90290: its not that we can go and enforce it
1/12/25, 11:18 AM - +91 77450 90290: what makes you think that??
1/12/25, 11:18 AM - +91 77450 90290: @919941637224
1/12/25, 11:18 AM - Krrish Gupta: bro wtf is wrong with you. its clearly not in their hands what the profs choose. they sent a large ass mail to use cpp/c and chops still chose python only no. clearly all they can do is just send mail
1/12/25, 11:18 AM - +91 99416 37224: So you guys are? Yay? Lesgo
1/12/25, 11:19 AM - +91 99416 37224: This says that you are trying to look for a C/C++ mixture, not C++ or Python as was the initial plan
1/12/25, 11:19 AM - +91 99416 37224: No it's not
1/12/25, 11:20 AM - +91 99416 37224: Its not in their hands to choose*
1/12/25, 11:20 AM - +91 77450 90290: because thats the approach seniors advised us on - they haven't been able to change it to outright C++ for the past 10 years <This message was edited>
1/12/25, 11:20 AM - +91 98714 31209: theres a reason dsa is in c in iiith since so many years u learn to create each data structure from scratch and youll be having osn next sem which is 5k lines of code purely in c so better not crib
1/12/25, 11:20 AM - Krrish Gupta: lol complaining about learning dsa in c is stupid
1/12/25, 11:20 AM - +91 77450 90290: thats exactly what your and adityas messages are implying
1/12/25, 11:20 AM - +91 77450 90290: ikr
1/12/25, 11:21 AM - +91 73372 95535: Yes but please push back against it changing to C
1/12/25, 11:21 AM - +91 77450 90290: no
1/12/25, 11:21 AM - +91 77450 90290: i myself have busted my ass for this
1/12/25, 11:21 AM - +91 99416 37224: I was trying to say that you guys should have tried to push for x not C
But if that isn't going to happen, what am I to say?
1/12/25, 11:21 AM - +91 77450 90290: i am not fucking doing this until every single person in this batch personally comes up to me and tells me this
1/12/25, 11:22 AM - +91 73372 95535: We're saying you shouldn't be content with C instead of C++ bc it's worse than both python and C++
1/12/25, 11:22 AM - Krrish Gupta: wait do you want python?
1/12/25, 11:22 AM - +91 91759 77518: Guys i think the mps have done the most they can w regard to this
1/12/25, 11:22 AM - +91 91759 77518: If we annoy the profs too much they won’t be inclined to listen to us
1/12/25, 11:22 AM - +91 99416 37224: No shit lmao
1/12/25, 11:22 AM - +91 98714 31209: bruh r u guys mad do u really want to create a joke out of urselves in front of the prof like ra last sem first u pushed from python to c c++ when they denied mps put the most effort to get it to c do u really want c avg in dsa also or wht
1/12/25, 11:22 AM - +91 77450 90290: i did say we will push for cpp but that comes later
1/12/25, 11:22 AM - +91 91759 77518: They’ve been sent the poll, they know cpp is the majority’s choice
1/12/25, 11:22 AM - +91 77450 90290: god you ppl have no tact or what
1/12/25, 11:22 AM - +91 73372 95535: either that or C++
1/12/25, 11:23 AM - +91 77450 90290: you cant demand stuff like this
1/12/25, 11:23 AM - +91 91759 77518: If they are vehement about either c or python then it makes sense to go ask again
1/12/25, 11:23 AM - +91 73372 95535: you're literally the POC
1/12/25, 11:23 AM - +91 91759 77518: Not continuously pester
1/12/25, 11:23 AM - +91 73372 95535: who else do we contact
1/12/25, 11:23 AM - +91 99416 37224: Makes sense
1/12/25, 11:23 AM - +91 91759 77518: Esp considering that everything seems to be in a deciding phase rn
1/12/25, 11:23 AM - +91 77450 90290: i am not saying dont contact me
1/12/25, 11:23 AM - +91 77450 90290: im saying think a little please 😭
1/12/25, 11:23 AM - +91 72044 30421: DSA hi hata do DS 2 laga do😀😀😀
1/12/25, 11:24 AM - +91 76790 41770: imagine shooting oneself on the foot 💀


DSA being difficult 💀, Plus adding C to that 💀💀
1/12/25, 11:24 AM - +91 73372 95535: what does that mean
1/12/25, 11:24 AM - +91 99416 37224: Srinathan supremacy
1/12/25, 11:24 AM - +91 98714 31209: @917745090290 lite le kuch mat kar python se c kradia enough
1/12/25, 11:24 AM - +91 98714 31209: isse zyada kya krega
1/12/25, 11:24 AM - Ayush: Python better if the goal of our DSA syllabus is to write accurate pseudocode and understand abstractions
1/12/25, 11:25 AM - Ayush: If simple implementation is needed then C or C++ but the prof has been dishing out concept after concept in python anyways
1/12/25, 11:25 AM - +91 77450 90290: 1. we mps did not _choose_ anything; we made our case for cpp, they said no outright. after the disastrous lab, we asked what the heck and they said ok we'll make it c. now we have the intent to push for cpp later.
2. the labs will now be in the normal format, not the functional programming bullshit. wait for the mail for more details <This message was edited>
1/12/25, 11:26 AM - +91 72044 30421: Bro if the college only thought python is lite we could have kept that no C trauma is retarded FUCK CPRO
1/12/25, 11:26 AM - +91 77450 90290: oh wait wrong tag
1/12/25, 11:26 AM - +91 77450 90290: nvm
1/12/25, 11:26 AM - Krrish Gupta: i think initially learning DSA in C is a better choice. sure we can switch to cpp later on in the course, but atleast in the beginning we will understand everything whats happening under the hood. and if you are worried about writing extra code in labs, then they can still provide pre-written code in labs and we just have to use those functions to implement the data structure.
1/12/25, 11:26 AM - +91 77450 90290: ikr 😭
1/12/25, 11:26 AM - +91 72044 30421: AYYYY KANNAN SAR MENTIONED WEEEWOOO😡😡😡🔥🔥🔥🔥
(kannan4lyf)
1/12/25, 11:26 AM - Ayush: We needed C to understand low level, not to take memory for granted
1/12/25, 11:26 AM - +91 77450 90290: concept after concept matlab are you talking about the lab stuff?
1/12/25, 11:26 AM - Manan: Guys right now we should just take C later down the sem we will ~beg~ ask the professor for CPP
1/12/25, 11:27 AM - +91 77450 90290: that wont be there anyways now
1/12/25, 11:27 AM - Ayush: Especially friday lab
1/12/25, 11:27 AM - +91 77450 90290: haa that we argued against, its not going to be like that anymore
1/12/25, 11:27 AM - +91 77450 90290: normal labs hoge like last year's dsa
1/12/25, 11:27 AM - Manan: Germany acquiring Rhineland before WW2 type shi
1/12/25, 11:27 AM - Ayush: I'm not in the groups anyways but reading 104 paged document to write bubble sort mathematically is insane
1/12/25, 11:27 AM - Eashaan Thakur: <Media omitted>
1/12/25, 11:27 AM - +91 77450 90290: that is what we intend to do
1/12/25, 11:28 AM - +91 99893 97880: Bhai how many times are we gonna mail proffs and ask them change their decision lol? Proffs hai vo . We shldnt annoy them much Varna laga denge in exams and all
1/12/25, 11:28 AM - +91 77450 90290: @917337295535 this is what i meant by think
1/12/25, 11:28 AM - +91 77450 90290: they're profs at the end of day you cant demand stuff
1/12/25, 11:28 AM - +91 72044 30421: they are gonna do that anyways da
1/12/25, 11:29 AM - +91 76790 41770: <Media omitted>
1/12/25, 11:29 AM - +91 72044 30421: anyways if they wanna sock us they'll sock us might as well piss them off FUCK GIRISH😡😡😡😡😡
1/12/25, 11:29 AM - +91 72044 30421: switch iiit for bits atp wat even is this college😭
1/12/25, 11:29 AM - +91 73372 95535: bro u demanded c++ you can still request for c++ oor python instead of C
1/12/25, 11:29 AM - +91 73372 95535: like I understand you don't want to pester them
1/12/25, 11:29 AM - +91 73372 95535: but you asking is why this chanfe came about in the first place
1/12/25, 11:30 AM - +91 73372 95535: all I'm asking is that you politely request (not demand) that they reconsider
1/12/25, 11:30 AM - +91 77450 90290: we did not demand anything
we requested for c/cpp
we got outright rejected

they conducted a shitty lab
we complained 
they said we'll switch back to c
lini ma'am is looking at the labs now
we'll push for cpp later
1/12/25, 11:30 AM - +91 72044 30421: we wanted c++ > python > c no for c python only would have been better no😭😭
1/12/25, 11:31 AM - +91 99416 37224: C/C++?
1/12/25, 11:31 AM - +91 73372 95535: why c/cpp?
1/12/25, 11:31 AM - +91 73372 95535: batch wanted C++ oonly
1/12/25, 11:31 AM - +91 82879 90914: The way the lab was conducted could have been changed but why was the language changed from python to c
1/12/25, 11:31 AM - +91 77450 90290: we actually said cpp in the mail, but we said later that c would be fine to the profs
1/12/25, 11:31 AM - +91 73372 95535: yeah
1/12/25, 11:31 AM - +91 99416 37224: Uhh?
1/12/25, 11:32 AM - +91 73372 95535: after consulting whom??
1/12/25, 11:32 AM - +91 72044 30421: WHYYYYYY😭
Guruji why😭
Why C😭
1/12/25, 11:32 AM - +91 97415 10648: isn't c++ extremely easy if you alr know C? better na
1/12/25, 11:32 AM - +91 76790 41770: <Media omitted>
1/12/25, 11:32 AM - +91 73372 95535: i don't think we ever agreed to this
1/12/25, 11:32 AM - +91 73372 95535: as a batch
1/12/25, 11:32 AM - +91 72044 30421: 😭cpro endsems reduced my cg by 1 number best of luck da
1/12/25, 11:32 AM - +91 80106 28917: Why?? What was the problem with python?? If we were not getting cpp
1/12/25, 11:32 AM - +91 77450 90290: the labs were the problem
1/12/25, 11:33 AM - +91 77450 90290: were you in fridays lab??
1/12/25, 11:33 AM - +91 76790 41770: that was a temporary thing, ungraded.

Overall the course would have been easier with Python
1/12/25, 11:33 AM - +91 73372 95535: you shouldn't be making decisions on behalf of the batch without asking everyone first
1/12/25, 11:33 AM - +91 77450 90290: let me tell you that was not temporary
1/12/25, 11:33 AM - +91 98714 31209: u wish it was temporary
1/12/25, 11:33 AM - +91 77450 90290: we did not make that decision to say ok to c, senior parliament members did <This message was edited>
1/12/25, 11:33 AM - +91 76790 41770: that style of writing code was temporary
1/12/25, 11:34 AM - +91 77450 90290: c*
1/12/25, 11:34 AM - +91 99416 37224: You mean C right? Or am I missing something?
1/12/25, 11:34 AM - +91 77450 90290: no it was not
chopella wanted it for the entire course
1/12/25, 11:34 AM - +91 77450 90290: yes i meant c sorry
1/12/25, 11:34 AM - +91 73372 95535: ok but my point still stands you didn't ask the batch
1/12/25, 11:34 AM - +91 80106 28917: This couldn't be the excuse there could be other ways to conduct labs just for labs sake u couldn't compromise with the whole course
1/12/25, 11:34 AM - +91 98714 31209: kulkarni escape varna 1 ghanta justification hi deta rahega
1/12/25, 11:34 AM - +91 70932 00799: this was a decision that was taken by the senior parliament members and the TAs
1/12/25, 11:34 AM - +91 99416 37224: Yeah Vedant, not like we can do much now anyways
1/12/25, 11:35 AM - +91 90632 81652: As far as I heard from people and tas, it is good to implement data structures in c while dsa is good to do in cpp
1/12/25, 11:35 AM - +91 77450 90290: there was not
1/12/25, 11:35 AM - +91 80106 28917: Yeah should have conducted the poll
1/12/25, 11:35 AM - +91 99416 37224: Let's C how many of us sit with our juniors in the future though 😂💀
1/12/25, 11:35 AM - +91 76790 41770: True, and the lab wasn't even that bad. If we listened to what Choppella yapped about as "theory"
1/12/25, 11:35 AM - +91 98492 33901: Bhai pls stop this rant on c
1/12/25, 11:35 AM - +91 98492 33901: C is a base
1/12/25, 11:35 AM - +91 91759 77518: I believe they’ll end up w a balance of using both a little bit
1/12/25, 11:35 AM - +91 98492 33901: We can extend it to cpp
1/12/25, 11:35 AM - +91 90632 81652: This is a good idea
1/12/25, 11:36 AM - +91 77450 90290: we didnt make the decision to say ok to C, seniors and tas did that
we couldnt really oppose them
1/12/25, 11:36 AM - +91 99416 37224: <Media omitted>
1/12/25, 11:36 AM - +91 72044 30421: mail spam🥹🥹
1/12/25, 11:36 AM - +91 91759 77518: But for now they’re saying c to shut everybody up for a bit while they decide maybe
1/12/25, 11:36 AM - +91 76790 41770: and that base is complex. so either we Focus on base and format or DSA knowledge
1/12/25, 11:36 AM - +91 98714 31209: c++=c+easier implemneation of graphs thats it lite
1/12/25, 11:37 AM - +91 77450 90290: im also sick and tired of listening to 4 ppl claiming to speak for the entire batch because oh so sad their favourite language is no longer being used
1/12/25, 11:37 AM - +91 91759 77518: The whole point was for that base and format to be learnt last semester in a course fully centred around the language
1/12/25, 11:37 AM - +91 98714 31209: and graphs is the 2nd last topic so doesnt make a diff till then
1/12/25, 11:37 AM - +91 76790 41770: it's pretty difficult to write logic stressfree when u have to deal with pointers and memory alloc and all everywhere
1/12/25, 11:37 AM - +91 77450 90290: this is the decision, live with it
1/12/25, 11:37 AM - +91 91759 77518: You don’t seem to understand that python is NOT the dsa standard
1/12/25, 11:37 AM - +91 77450 90290: hate me for it, blame me for it, i literally could not care less
1/12/25, 11:37 AM - +91 63541 09703: Real shit
1/12/25, 11:37 AM - +91 72044 30421: lite it seems nigga cpro didn't fuck u over uh😭
1/12/25, 11:37 AM - +91 98492 33901: Yes I get it that cpp is easier for the data structures, but then what's the point of half the course if we don't learn data structures? 
Creating them from scratch is excruciatingly painful, as we saw with linked lists (which was just the beginning), but if we do, we can get better than any other clg
1/12/25, 11:37 AM - +91 77450 90290: i have busted my ass for y'all for the past two weeks so that you dont fail in the course
1/12/25, 11:37 AM - +91 98492 33901: As they say, more the pain, more the gain
1/12/25, 11:37 AM - +91 98714 31209: girish sadist not lini dw

1/12/25, 11:38 AM - +91 91759 77518: If you didn’t learn it you don’t get to fuck over the rest of your batch by using a high level language with an unclear base
1/12/25, 11:38 AM - +91 70932 00799: exactly and right now you guys accusing of such things is really disheartening honestly
1/12/25, 11:38 AM - +91 98714 31209: nahi nahi lini achi bachi h
1/12/25, 11:38 AM - +91 91759 77518: That’s literally the worst thing you can do as a programmer

PPL ARE MAD AT VEDANT FOR THE C THING?????
1/12/25, 11:38 AM - +91 72040 03381: Wtfaf
1/12/25, 11:38 AM - +91 72859 06873: we're going to get fucked over either way

if its in c, atleast we get fucked over in a familiar language
1/12/25, 11:39 AM - +91 91759 77518: Exactly; stop blaming one of the few people who’s actually in a position to help everybody
1/12/25, 11:39 AM - +91 98714 31209: real shit
1/12/25, 11:39 AM - +91 72040 03381: ??
1/12/25, 11:39 AM - +91 99416 37224: I might be speaking for myself, but I was just trying to get things clarified
Any offence caused is sorely regretted
1/12/25, 11:39 AM - +91 72859 06873: bro like didnt we have a poll and all also

1/12/25, 11:39 AM - +91 72859 06873: why are people mad
1/12/25, 11:39 AM - +91 99416 37224: Hi
1/12/25, 11:39 AM - +91 77450 90290: oh fuck off
what happened to the "but the entire batch" rhetoric you and aditya were throwing at me 10 seconds ago
1/12/25, 11:39 AM - +91 99416 37224: That was the clarification 💀
1/12/25, 11:39 AM - +91 98714 31209: why does it matter to u u r in kassimaxing phase u can do dsa in any lang
1/12/25, 11:39 AM - +91 72044 30421: poll had different output overall is different output but guruji ftw we love guruji🫡🫡

1/12/25, 11:40 AM - +91 98714 31209: good work mps
1/12/25, 11:40 AM - +91 96633 60173: They got change done
1/12/25, 11:40 AM - +91 77450 90290: we did in every place possible
when the tas and seniors took a decision for us, we did not oppose because it was not our place too. they have sat thru these courses and placements and know what is best for us.

1/12/25, 11:40 AM - +91 99416 37224: We didn't know that it was the senior MPs who had asked you guys to accept C as a compromise, how are we to have known?

1/12/25, 11:43 AM - +91 99416 37224: Well, we didn't know what happened behind the scenes either? So how are we to have responded "aptly"?

1/12/25, 11:44 AM - +91 70932 00799: You do realise that getting a course structure changed is a big piece of work right?
1/12/25, 11:44 AM - +91 73372 95535: Bro just look at how much easier it is to implement things in cpp and python
1/12/25, 11:45 AM - +91 72859 06873: thats exactly why we need to learn it in c 😭
1/12/25, 11:45 AM - +91 72040 03381: Vedant and the other MPs worked relentlessly against unreasonable professors and faculty simply to make things easier for us after intense discussions and polls which i remember clearly. Not to mention, all mps consulted numerous seniors, TAs and did extensive research (evident by the detailed pros and cons message they released) and quite frankly some of them are incredibly experienced in the matter as well. 


Despite being shot down the fact that they worked so hard to change the system perhaps more than any batch has ever fought for before is insane and instead of gratitude seeing anger is quite baffling in my opinion. Throughout the semesters the MPs have been nothing but extremely hardworking, dedicated and literally committed towards listening to our endless complaints and whining. 

I personally want to know and address the PPL who have issues with the MPs and the decisions they've made because ffs they r humans too and they've done too much for us already

@919941637224 @917337295535 
Please tell me



It is very easy to be an armchair driver and give criticism while sitting from the comfort of not having to do this work yourself.

I can't do much else to set things right

1/12/25, 11:46 AM - +91 63541 09703: You do realise it was standard that you do the entire course in C so we do not get fucked in OSN next semester? The TAs and eacha ND every goddam individual of this college told specifically that since we are having it in python, our OSN is gonna get fucked. You do realise that since it is changed to c finally, we might have to type more but the questions will be a little easier than they would have been w python cuz of all the time saving we would have done in typing code ? If you still wanna argue about how python is nice and easy. It is. But nice and easy isn't gonna land u grades in DSA or OSN .

1/12/25, 11:47 AM - +91 73372 95535: Stop twisting my words I never said they don't do a lot for the batch.. I'm giving my opinion just like everyone in the batch does about these things
1/12/25, 11:47 AM - +91 96633 60173: Agreed
1/12/25, 11:47 AM - +91 98492 33901: Hail Hitler
1/12/25, 11:47 AM - +91 72040 03381: Ok
Tell me
What ur opinion is
I wanna know
1/12/25, 11:47 AM - +91 70759 70819: As clarifications, we sent the original mail to request for cpp and, on advice of senipr mps and tas, c. This was instantly rejected by choppella, and we were stuck with python.

After Lab 2 of python, we took up the case again, and set out a few points saying why the lab wasn't great to the profs (again, on advice of senior mps and tas), and asking if they could do something about that. We did not in any way suggest anything to them. They responded by saying that we would revert to the old course structure.  

After giving it a break, we'll ask for cpp if a majority of the batch wants it, but this js how things stand rn
1/12/25, 11:47 AM - +91 72044 30421: Nah NO FUCKING WAY U SAID THAT
1/12/25, 11:47 AM - +91 72044 30421: GUYS WTF HOW IS THIS ALLOWED

1/12/25, 11:48 AM - +91 77450 90290: no you're not giving your opinion
you are trying to talk as the entire batch and shitting on every single step we took just because you didnt like the outcome without even listening to what we have to say 
theres a difference
1/12/25, 11:48 AM - +91 72040 03381: @mps let me represent u for a change <3
1/12/25, 11:48 AM - +91 99416 37224: How many times am I going to have to repeat myself 
I didn't know the how the whole thing rested, and based off of the little information that I had, I queried the MPs
I might have come off as rude, or hurtful, and hence I apologised then, just as I apologise now
I was just trying to exercise my right to question the decisions taken by the elected representatives of this batch, and I might have been slightly problematic in the way I dealt with the issue
I apologise wholeheartedly for this gaffe @917745090290 @917075970819 @917093200799 and the other MPs
1/12/25, 11:48 AM - +91 70759 70819: Love you bbg but issok

1/12/25, 11:49 AM - +91 72040 03381: Querying the MPs is something to be done in private 
In dms 
Or one on one
You do understand human nature to want to create fights and involve in conflict, especially in a batch group of 100+ people
When u "state ur opinion" especially when u said you didn't know the whole thing, you are essentially instigating a movement against the MPs and quite literally disrespecting them

1/12/25, 11:51 AM - +91 99416 37224: I usually do keep these queries to the DMs, but then on the other hand, I was sure that I was not the only one who might have had some lingering issues with this thing, and hence I messaged here
I am so sorry for having stirred up this bee hive @mps
1/12/25, 11:51 AM - +91 72044 30421: this house believes that Girish verma is retarded.

It's very easy to criticize and whine about the MPs work especially since they're so lenient and sweet about it

Imo they're too understanding

1/12/25, 7:46 PM - +91 72859 06873: election interference is not "putting down woke ideologies"
1/12/25, 7:46 PM - +91 81253 19531: 💀💀

1/12/25, 7:48 PM - +91 79763 44711: he literally offered to pay citizens to vote
1/12/25, 7:48 PM - +91 81253 19531: oj

1/12/25, 7:48 PM - +91 99416 37224: He didn't do "illegal" shit
But he did do completely unethical stuff
1/12/25, 7:49 PM - +91 81253 19531: Nah he did stuff thats illegal
1/12/25, 7:49 PM - +91 79763 44711: is unethical not election interference though?
1/12/25, 7:49 PM - +91 70193 18279: like fr example, teaching small kids gender ideologies and stuff and allowing permanent changes to body at a very young age. 
More focus on stuff like gender, race etc etc than on actual stuff like science, tech or people actually getting things they want
1/12/25, 7:49 PM - +91 81253 19531: man
1/12/25, 7:49 PM - +91 72040 03381: Actual stuff is crazy

1/12/25, 7:50 PM - +91 72040 03381: As a person who loves stem and despises the humanities personally I can assure u one is not "realer" than the other
1/12/25, 7:50 PM - +91 99416 37224: I was just saying that paying voters to "vote" isn't illegal per se
But most of us know what he meant
1/12/25, 7:50 PM - +91 72040 03381: Us
1/12/25, 7:50 PM - +91 93445 29774: Why are we even arguing with this guy man ain't even worth it
1/12/25, 7:50 PM - +91 81253 19531: Dude I actually laughed so much lmao
1/12/25, 7:50 PM - +91 79763 44711: 1) you were taught gender ideology as a kid thats why you knew hwat straight and gay people are
2) no democrat or liberal has ever argued for gender surgery or HRT for minors and its banned everywhere with no exceptions
3) the republican party is literally built upon destroying class solidarity and playing identity politics to create a divide to win votes rather than actual policies, they do not give a shit about science or tech and are usually pretty shit when it comes to those things
1/12/25, 7:51 PM - +91 93445 29774: I'm literally losing the few iq points I have listening to this guy
1/12/25, 7:51 PM - +91 70193 18279: I never said that i support republicans unequivocally at all

1/12/25, 7:52 PM - +91 79763 44711: yeah but “woke ideology” falls apart because it’s a narrative pushed by the republican party which uses lies and false narratives to push a false agenda and create a divide of us vs. them
1/12/25, 7:52 PM - +91 70193 18279: but wokeness is what is defined as too much sensitivity to stuff that doesn't matter much and should be more ignored like race, ethnicity, gender etc. 
that is wrong
1/12/25, 7:52 PM - +91 89189 66044: Since many were questioning me how i am saying ba - bc = 0

1/16/25, 11:43 PM - +91 81253 19531: Hello everyone and welcome to the first ever IIIT Pokemon Community Playthrough. In these playthroughs we shall be picking up a Pokemon game (mainline for now) and we shall relive the good old days by playing through them.

RULES:
To participate, first fill this form: https://forms.gle/uRJbe1hbDC9v1iHW6. 
Then, join the Pokemon fan club group on WhatsApp: https://chat.whatsapp.com/EVZRBU8OkZW53ORHBEjPof. This is important as all ROM files and emulator files will be uploaded on this group, along with the playthrough discussion.
We have set up a few checkpoints. Reach the checkpoint before the deadline (These deadlines are flexible do not worry) and send a screenshot of your team and the save dialog, showing the time taken and Pokedex numbers, either personally to me or in the group. This has to be done after every checkpoint.
You can continue playing, but DO NOT cross the boundaries of the checkpoint, until the deadline is finished. The idea is for the players to go through the game together.
ALL SORTS OF HACKING AND CHEATS ARE BANNED. You may trade with any other participants but inform me whom and what the trade was.
Have fun <3

Our very first playthrough will bring us back to the good old days of Hoenn, traversing the infinite sea paths in the region. We shall be running Pokemon Emerald!

Here are the checkpoints for Pokemon Emerald:
18th - 23rd: Defeat Wattson and obtain the Dynamo Badge from Wattson. Do not obtain the Rock Smash HM yet. 
24th - 29th: Defeat your rival after obtaining Castform from the Weather Institute. Do not battle Winona yet.
2nd - 7th: Break up Groudon & Kyogre by summoning Rayquaza. Do not battle Juan yet.
8th - 13th: Defeat Wallace and be crowned Hoenn Champion!

After you defeat Wallace, send your entire team, including moves on the Pokemon to either me or in the group and they will be recorded in the Hall of Fame.

Happy Playing! Reach out to me if you have any questions whatsoever.

1/17/25, 9:02 PM - +91 79763 44711: nan why would you make this
1/17/25, 9:03 PM - +91 72044 30421: Dear Joshua,
I believe that all humans irrespective of their skin colour must be actively included in all activities we perform conjugatively as a society, simply because this policy forms the base of humanity.
1/17/25, 9:03 PM - +91 72044 30421: HELL YEAH
1/17/25, 9:03 PM - +91 72044 30421: they told me to man I just do my job
1/17/25, 9:03 PM - +91 72044 30421: RUSHIL GG ASF
1/17/25, 9:08 PM - +91 93445 29774: It appears my explanations were not properly explained. At the given timings it will be too dark for people to see a dark-skinned individual such as myself, due to the limitations of the human eye to not be able to differentiate dark objects in a dark setting. Participating would only be an inconvenience for people, who would find it difficult to interact with me given my invisible nature, no matter how much they believe in the equality of all
1/17/25, 9:09 PM - +91 81253 19531: Yall will do this sort of promo and wont even show up later on 💀
1/17/25, 9:14 PM - +91 81253 19531: Anyways forget meet JOIN EMERALD PLAYTHROUGH RAAAAH https://forms.gle/uRJbe1hbDC9v1iHW6
1/17/25, 9:17 PM - +91 72044 30421: Dear Joshua,
I don't think you understand the empathy behind my message. Yes, I realize that you are very dark, maybe even too dark to be seen in such a setting. However, the inconvenience of other people must not be your concern. I assure you that with my 6/6 vision, I will be able to spot you in even the darkest of scenarios.
Yours,
Kim Jong Un

Everybody I know has been falling horribly sick in the past week, I think the numbers will only increase in the next month as well
1/22/25, 8:59 AM - +91 70759 70819: Unfortunately not
1/22/25, 8:59 AM - +91 70759 70819: Millions of people have tried and they have all failed

i have 101 fever with bad sore throat and extreme headache 
and i asked for leave and she goes with i can’t give you leave 
leave is granted when you have severe case that is cancer or any limb dislocated
1/22/25, 11:59 AM - +91 99493 05963: yes apparently you cant apply for sports leave if you have minor injuries, you can only if its like fractures and so on

1/22/25, 12:01 PM - +91 99100 97808: Did they seriously say the words cancer and limb dislocation

1/22/25, 12:03 PM - +91 99280 88006: "Sorry mate, you got 4 months to live but ur still gonna fail ur course"

1/22/25, 12:18 PM - +91 63542 88270: Yeah the same has happened with me, they are actually waiting for u to get worse and then ask for leave ..makes no sense
1/22/25, 12:18 PM - +91 93445 29774: Does everyone who work here have ego issues or sumtin that they feel the need to screw over random teenagers
1/22/25, 12:19 PM - +91 72040 03381: Yup they said last sem

Don't take dolo 
Let the fever reach high temperature
Get it checked in arogya and then take dolo 🤡

1/22/25, 12:20 PM - +91 81253 19531: Simply love the people and their fragile egos so much 🔥🔥
1/22/25, 12:20 PM - +91 63542 88270: yeah they are not at all considerate
1/22/25, 12:20 PM - +91 93445 29774: These people are actively worsening students health so that they can sell medicine or shit
1/22/25, 12:20 PM - +91 98492 33901: btw does clg accept medical reports from other hospitals? or it takes only aarogya?
1/22/25, 12:20 PM - +91 93445 29774: This shouldn't even be legal
1/22/25, 12:21 PM - +91 72040 03381: Anywhere
1/22/25, 12:21 PM - Poonam: They don't charge for meds tho yeah?
1/22/25, 12:21 PM - +91 93445 29774: Willing to bet that he said something along the lines of "it's all in your head"
1/22/25, 12:22 PM - +91 98492 33901: then taking a report elsewhere is much better than taking at aarogya (except for the fact that it costs outside)
1/22/25, 12:22 PM - +91 81253 19531: <Media omitted>
1/22/25, 12:22 PM - +91 98492 33901: so true
1/22/25, 12:22 PM - +91 72040 03381: They don't give meds💀
1/22/25, 12:22 PM - +91 93445 29774: If they aren't charging then that makes it even more psychopathic
1/22/25, 12:22 PM - +91 72040 03381: They give like two dolo max
1/22/25, 12:22 PM - +91 72040 03381: They don't even give more than 2 strepcils at once afaik 💀💀💀
1/22/25, 12:22 PM - +91 98492 33901: they prescribe for a week, and then give u a sample that works for 1 (or at most 2) days

1/22/25, 12:28 PM - +91 99100 97808: Honestly whenever I go to aarogya anymore I don't tell them my condition or ask them to do any checks I just tell them what medicines I want and they hand it over 😭 not sure if it's a clinic or a dispensary atp
1/22/25, 12:28 PM - +91 99100 97808: Easier to self diagnose and self treat + actually getting leave even with a medical certificate is a pain
1/22/25, 12:29 PM - +91 96633 60173: The getting leave part is the issue, everyone knows aarogya is shit, but getting leaves is problematic when its shit
1/22/25, 12:31 PM - +91 93445 29774: Easy, if your fever is really bad just get cancer or break one of your limbs so that they'll give you leavw
1/22/25, 12:34 PM - +91 90919 29888: How many limbs can you break before you have to deal with the bureaucracy again
1/22/25, 12:35 PM - +91 93445 29774: Hopefully by the time you get a fever again one of the broken bones should've fixed fully to break again
1/22/25, 12:45 PM - +91 70759 70819: Yes it takes from other hospitals
1/22/25, 12:45 PM - +91 70759 70819: But you have to get aarogya medical certificate in the end
1/22/25, 12:46 PM - +91 99493 05963: its just a bunch of losers going on a power trip
1/22/25, 12:47 PM - +91 93445 29774: So even if u fucked, aarogya can just say no?
1/22/25, 12:47 PM - +91 70759 70819: No, aarogya has to give medical certificate if you have a prescription
1/22/25, 12:47 PM - +91 70759 70819: They don't have a say in that

1/22/25, 11:07 PM - +91 74978 08993: I don't think TAs can do anything in this case. I'm gonna talk to prof. on Saturday about moderation in GenAI usage or something similar to make everyone learn topics properly rather than 'only' prompt engineering. If anyone has any idea on what can be done, please share
1/22/25, 11:08 PM - +91 75583 83806: ❤️❤️❤️
1/22/25, 11:08 PM - +91 74978 08993: And will ask to keep this lab ungraded as well
1/22/25, 11:08 PM - +91 75583 83806: Sanyam the goat fr
1/22/25, 11:08 PM - +91 74978 08993: Though, you all know ISS prof
1/22/25, 11:09 PM - +91 99416 37224: More than moderation, I'd suggest a larger time frame to solve the questions 
The problem is clearly the fact that we do not have the time to think/apply/understand chatgpt's answers which caused this debacle in the lab
Given enough time, it shouldn't matter whether people used AI or not, since at that point, everyone would more or less have a right answer, and those who choose the easier way of prompt engineering would be at a significant disadvantage
1/22/25, 11:10 PM - +91 74978 08993: This point is going to be there for sure
1/22/25, 11:12 PM - +91 77450 90290: note that apex ~predators~ are still on palash

1/28/25, 10:13 AM - +91 93445 29774: Atleast lining teaches well and I don't mind paying attention, Siddhartha is literal torture
1/28/25, 10:13 AM - +91 99003 73186: Ya she teaches well I'm not saying she doesn't. But I don't understand why we're being forced to pay attention

1/28/25, 1:59 PM - +91 99416 37224: Regardless, if it's nitpicking that we wish to do, then neither date is related to the Non Cooperation movement 🤷
1/28/25, 2:00 PM - +91 70759 70819: It is the year india gained independence -_-

1/28/25, 6:38 PM - +91 99416 37224: Who asked for an extension?
1/28/25, 6:39 PM - +91 99416 37224: I mean, doesn't it make more sense to have saved that card to play it when the whole batch needs it and thing?
1/28/25, 6:39 PM - +91 81143 91950: feb 2nd damn 💀
1/28/25, 6:40 PM - +91 80782 07252: Oh yeah

1/28/25, 7:09 PM - +91 80782 07252: I agree
1/28/25, 7:09 PM - +91 80782 07252: We had 2 weeks man 💀
1/28/25, 7:09 PM - +91 89189 66044: I feel bad for my roomie who did not slept yesterday and skipped today's class for this shit
1/28/25, 7:10 PM - +91 79763 44711: i mean
1/28/25, 7:10 PM - +91 79763 44711: same argument goes the other way
1/28/25, 7:10 PM - +91 79763 44711: if you had 2 weeks why didnt you do it earlier
1/28/25, 7:10 PM - +91 79763 44711: why were you cramming it now
1/28/25, 7:10 PM - +91 93445 29774: I had a skill issue in solving and tool longer than expected?
1/28/25, 7:11 PM - +91 80782 07252: doesnt make sense for a deadline extension tho
1/28/25, 7:11 PM - +91 79763 44711: the people who are going to be solving it during the deadline are anyways losing quiz prep time
1/28/25, 7:11 PM - +91 79763 44711: you can focus on quiz now
1/28/25, 7:11 PM - +91 89189 66044: Yeah advantage lol

1/28/25, 7:13 PM - +91 89189 66044: Sleep -> brain ok -> common sense regained -> ace exam with common sense
1/28/25, 7:14 PM - +91 93445 29774: Think exam is based on common sense -> fail exam coz sir will prolly decide to ask theory based questions
1/28/25, 7:16 PM - +91 89189 66044: Lets assume u prefer to study instead of healthy sleep, so during exam (no matter thoery or prac), u will feel sleepy -> bad concentration -> bad exam
1/28/25, 7:17 PM - +91 93445 29774: Can't feel sleepy in an exam with all that stress and tension
1/28/25, 7:17 PM - +91 89189 66044: I think i am the only nigga who gets sleepy no matter how tense it is

1/28/25, 7:33 PM - +91 93445 29774: Even the iss assignment 3rd problem is a squid game reference (red light green light mentioned, no I do not need help)
1/28/25, 7:33 PM - +91 98405 80218: there were 3 revisions lol

We are writing this email to mention some points regarding yuktahaar mess.

1.Please maintain queue system : Yesterday it is observed that many people are taking idli and roti without being in the queue. It hardly takes 5 more minutes to get your turn. To solve this problem, we are providing two counters for idli.

2.Route: As kadamb mess work is going on the route going to yuktahaar mess is changed. The new route is on the way going to badminton court of Kadamb.

3.Reporting:If you face any issue in yuktahaar first approach the staff, if not resolved there is a feedback register(will check by committee members regularly) and WhatsApp group to approach the committee.

4.Closing the lids: It is observed that many people are not closing the lids on the food containers. You have to take again from the same containers. So please all containers with lids after usage.

5.Shoe racks: Please use the shoe racks to keep your footwear. Tell us if you any objection regarding this and we are open to take any crazy ideas to implement this.

Thank you 
Yuktahaar committee

1/30/25, 11:54 AM - +91 70759 70819: I'm talking to the ta, if we skip this sat lab, we'll be properly lagging behind and at some point they will hold a friday-saturday lab in the same week

1/30/25, 2:38 PM - +91 63541 09703: "Id work for free if I got money da"
1/30/25, 2:38 PM - +91 72040 03381: Ok but getting attendance doesn't harm the cause
1/30/25, 2:46 PM - +91 72044 30421: Did u really compare me asking for attendance to me asking for MONEY
1/30/25, 2:46 PM - +91 72044 30421: it doesn't harm the pec people to give out attendance of it'll help some kids nod
1/30/25, 2:54 PM - +91 63541 09703: If u can't get the analogy then it's not my fault 💀
1/30/25, 2:54 PM - +91 72040 03381: Victim blaming is wild

Ur in the wrong here
I'm ok w elaborating if u want
1/30/25, 3:01 PM - +91 93445 29774: Arya vs nan going crazy
1/30/25, 3:02 PM - +91 63541 09703: The point of charity is to do it if you want and selflessly .. the whole point of her argument is will we get attendance which isn't selfless so I may be wrong in this but I'm not in the whole "i want attendance" cuz it's called charity for a reason 💀
1/30/25, 3:02 PM - +91 63541 09703: Nothing wrong in asking for it, but doing it just for attendance is wrong .. that being my point here <This message was edited>
1/30/25, 3:03 PM - +91 72040 03381: The point of charity is not selflessness 
Charity can have selfish roots 
Why do u think MNCs or billionaires donate 

Truly out of the goodness of their heart? Or incentives


Incentives like 
Social image
Media recognition
Tax exemptions
1/30/25, 3:03 PM - +91 72040 03381: Charity is defined by outcome and not intentions 
I'm p sure nobody has purely selfless intentions in mind
1/30/25, 3:03 PM - +91 79763 44711: hey guys join debsoc!
1/30/25, 3:03 PM - +91 99280 88006: Oh dear god...
1/30/25, 3:04 PM - +91 81253 19531: LMAO
1/30/25, 3:04 PM - +91 79763 44711: 😭😭
1/30/25, 3:04 PM - +91 72040 03381: Attendance doesn't negate the benefit of charity
It's simply an incentive
And in fact if the incentive motivates more PPL to participate and contribute then one could argue that it literally enhances and amplifies the charity by creating outreach and motivation
1/30/25, 3:04 PM - +91 63541 09703: Tata just have away 108 billion dollars? He would have gotten yhr same image with giving away 20 billion or 30 billion dollars. So
1/30/25, 3:04 PM - +91 81253 19531: Arya look at Musk
1/30/25, 3:04 PM - +91 72040 03381: Selflessness is not a requirement for charity
1/30/25, 3:04 PM - +91 63541 09703: Pretty sure if the outcome was to get people to join, they wouldn't call it charity in the first place
1/30/25, 3:04 PM - +91 72040 03381: U can help ppl and be a shitty person on the inside
1/30/25, 3:04 PM - +91 72040 03381: And vice versa
1/30/25, 3:04 PM - +91 81253 19531: Hes donated like $2B
1/30/25, 3:04 PM - +91 72040 03381: ??????
1/30/25, 3:05 PM - +91 72040 03381: People to join the charity event
1/30/25, 3:05 PM - +91 81253 19531: And hes still a fucking twat I wanna punch
1/30/25, 3:05 PM - +91 93445 29774: I LITERALLY ASKED LIKE, NO
1/30/25, 3:05 PM - +91 72040 03381: More incentives = more funds raised = greater cause
1/30/25, 3:05 PM - +91 72044 30421: Oh my god you have 0 logical arguments da just spamming sass doesn't make u sound cool like u think it does😭
1/30/25, 3:05 PM - +91 99416 37224: Don't most of you guys have an exam in like 55 mins? Why are you guys here 💀
1/30/25, 3:05 PM - +91 99280 88006: I think its the first time Joshua isn't in the debate :) (I THINK)
1/30/25, 3:05 PM - +91 80782 07252: guys can we have this debate after iot ☹️
1/30/25, 3:05 PM - +91 80782 07252: I also wanna participate
1/30/25, 3:05 PM - +91 72044 30421: Gettout nan wins anyday iot is nerfing me
1/30/25, 3:05 PM - +91 63541 09703: Nan talking about spam and sass is crazy
1/30/25, 3:05 PM - +91 93445 29774: Mf watchu say?
1/30/25, 3:06 PM - +91 99280 88006: lmfao mf get in then
1/30/25, 3:06 PM - +91 81253 19531: Padhke aundhe padhgaye
1/30/25, 3:06 PM - +91 72040 03381: Working for free for money is a direct paradox 


That completely contradicts the meaning of the word free


Whereas in nans argument, incentive of attendance did not tamper the meaning of the concept of charity


Whether ur point is morally right or wrong, your analogy was fallacious as fuck
1/30/25, 3:06 PM - +91 93445 29774: Iot lite man we don't even know what to study anyways
1/30/25, 3:06 PM - +91 72044 30421: 💀💀💀
Why should I be the only one who does it selflessly? This is like saying don't give the blood donors biscuits and juice because they should wanna do it _selflessly_
1/30/25, 3:06 PM - +91 72040 03381: I'll proxy dw

1/30/25, 3:07 PM - +91 72044 30421: Nigga if by giving attendance more people participate in a charity run then why not? Whats the con here?
1/30/25, 3:07 PM - +91 99280 88006: No im just overwhelmed by all this debate shii
1/30/25, 3:07 PM - +91 63541 09703: It isn't a requirement agreed but its the point of a charity that's why it's called a charity the whole point of doing something for someone without any personal benefit is called charity but wtv mahn look it how you will
1/30/25, 3:07 PM - +91 99280 88006: like, chill out.....fr
1/30/25, 3:07 PM - +91 72040 03381: If the personal benefit doesn't take away from the cause
What's wrong with that?
1/30/25, 3:07 PM - +91 72044 30421: Arya are you just debating this random aah topic where there is a clear correct side because u wanna feel like your opinion is heavy and cool💀
1/30/25, 3:07 PM - +91 72040 03381: Good things without bad things = good things
1/30/25, 3:07 PM - +91 72040 03381: Good things are good
1/30/25, 3:07 PM - +91 72040 03381: I don't see
1/30/25, 3:07 PM - +91 72040 03381: The issue
1/30/25, 3:07 PM - +91 72040 03381: We get attendance
Little kids get saved
1/30/25, 3:07 PM - +91 63541 09703: Nah you argue for cool lmao go study iot
1/30/25, 3:07 PM - +91 72044 30421: 💀💀💀💀
DAFUUUUUUQ
1/30/25, 3:07 PM - +91 72040 03381: Everyone's happy
1/30/25, 3:08 PM - +91 72044 30421: Ok da don't repeat my point now tf u doin😭
1/30/25, 3:08 PM - +91 99100 97808: i didn't know people went to blood donation camps for the biscuit and juice news to me
1/30/25, 3:08 PM - +91 72044 30421: ++++
1/30/25, 3:08 PM - +91 72044 30421: They don't, but an incentive like that is nice isn't it?
1/30/25, 3:08 PM - Poonam: that is wild bro
1/30/25, 3:08 PM - +91 72040 03381: The point is 
I highly doubt ppl in need care about the deep rooted intentions behind the charity
1/30/25, 3:08 PM - +91 81253 19531: <Media omitted>
1/30/25, 3:08 PM - +91 72044 30421: You misunderstood my point da😭
Read again once plej
1/30/25, 3:08 PM - +91 80782 07252: they're given biscuits and juice so that they don't fucking faint 💀 it's still selfless on their part
1/30/25, 3:08 PM - +91 72044 30421: This is 10/10 line
1/30/25, 3:08 PM - +91 99416 37224: In this case, its not the college organizing this afaik, and hence, the college cannot give incentives
If the people are interested in doing "charity", then they ought to participate
Expecting the college to give handouts is, well, insane
1/30/25, 3:09 PM - Poonam: is it unethical if Nagaraju offers ppl to donate blood for sports attendance in the last few days of the sem <This message was edited>
1/30/25, 3:09 PM - +91 63541 09703: That's what I'm saying asking for it isn't bad, you can and should ask for it but if you don't get what you want and then you don't do it, that's wrong na
1/30/25, 3:09 PM - +91 72044 30421: Exactly my point thank you
1/30/25, 3:09 PM - +91 72044 30421: Why is that wrong-
Wanting to do good so that good happens to you is not wrong at all.
In fact that's the most evolutionary basic human instinct ever no
1/30/25, 3:09 PM - +91 72044 30421: I'll give da
1/30/25, 3:10 PM - +91 72040 03381: If an influencer is donating food for clout 
Then let him
At the end of the day 
The people in need are getting food

Whether he was selfless or not 
Doesn't matter to them
Why do we care? Cuz were privileged enough to be able to debate the motives behind an action 

Debating philosophy of charity is a luxury 
But it shouldn't come in the way of the deed itself
1/30/25, 3:10 PM - +91 99100 97808: there's no con if they did it themselves, his argument (im assuming) is you shouldn't be asking for an incentive to do a good thing, either do it or don't ask it seems insensitive
1/30/25, 3:10 PM - +91 72040 03381: It's a hypothetical
1/30/25, 3:10 PM - +91 72044 30421: No, I am saying that because the college is advertising it, maybe it can play a part in supporting it as well?
Like how it's supporting the hyd marathon by giving people attendance and thereby increasing participation, maybe it can do that here as well?
1/30/25, 3:10 PM - +91 99100 97808: the important part is youre asking, regardless of whether there is an incentive or not
1/30/25, 3:11 PM - +91 72044 30421: Why shouldn't u ask for an incentive to do something good what-
I mean the fact that I'm willing to do good itself is a plus point on my belt no?
1/30/25, 3:11 PM - +91 99416 37224: Surely even in a hypothetical sense, questioning the college (or the authorities or whatever) and judging them for the fact that they aren't giving out freebies is kinda wrong?
1/30/25, 3:11 PM - +91 72044 30421: There is nothing wrong with hoping good happens to those who do good, on a fundamental level
1/30/25, 3:11 PM - +91 72040 03381: As a society we tend to nitpick on tiny things like political correctness or genuine mistakes that do not actually affect the people in need
1/30/25, 3:11 PM - +91 99100 97808: that's not for me to debate whether its fundamentally right or wrong, but in public perception it just seems insensitive that's all
1/30/25, 3:12 PM - +91 72044 30421: ++ exactly, the ultimate goal here is to help the children. If by giving attendance more children are protected then what's the harm
1/30/25, 3:12 PM - +91 79763 44711: <Media omitted>
1/30/25, 3:12 PM - +91 79763 44711: also yeah agreed
1/30/25, 3:12 PM - +91 72040 03381: In my opinion 
Again, just my two cents

Public is selfish 
We like to think we're doing something real by making sweet statements or calling out 'insensitive' opinions to give us the guise of action when we are participating in inaction 
It's a social performance to make us feel better about ourselves
1/30/25, 3:12 PM - +91 99416 37224: For the one reason that society believes that a person who is doing good is not doing so out of personal interests, but rather because they actually want to make a difference
If they get any benefit in the process, its good for them
1/30/25, 3:13 PM - +91 63541 09703: ....defeats the point of it being called a charity...if you wanna run for attendance then go Noones stopping you but if you wanna portrait it as a charity event, and then you proceed to ask if there is attendance and then you dont go when you dont get it, moots the point of it being a charity. There is money raised when people go on marathons without it being called a charity event. If it is charity, then you getting something in return shouldn't be a factor in deciding if you wanna participate or not is all my point is
1/30/25, 3:13 PM - +91 72044 30421: Well my point could have also been to promote the fact that giving attendance brings people. Maybe I was trying to promote the event as a whole by bringing attention of the masses to it. To simply villainize me for such an attempt is cruel😞😞😞
1/30/25, 3:13 PM - +91 72040 03381: She never said she won't run if there's no attendance
She simply asked if there would be
1/30/25, 3:13 PM - +91 63541 09703: Cmon u want me to believe that?
1/30/25, 3:13 PM - +91 72040 03381: I don't think you're right in assigning malicious undertones to her statement
1/30/25, 3:13 PM - +91 63541 09703: Ask her itself
1/30/25, 3:13 PM - +91 79763 44711: yeah but if it’s already social performance you asking for an incentive/ personal gain waters it down further
1/30/25, 3:13 PM - +91 99100 97808: that is your opinion and you are welcome to it but im just saying how it comes out to anyone
1/30/25, 3:13 PM - +91 72040 03381: It's a sports event 
It's a reasonable assumption
1/30/25, 3:13 PM - +91 72040 03381: Ik ik
1/30/25, 3:14 PM - +91 72040 03381: That's not what I meant
1/30/25, 3:14 PM - +91 72040 03381: Dm
1/30/25, 3:14 PM - +91 99416 37224: Now that this is no longer hypothetical
It is not a IIIT organized event
It is hence not a reasonable assumption?
1/30/25, 3:15 PM - +91 72044 30421: How the fuck is giving attendance going against the rules of charity? Them giving attendance to us is also charity in one way if you think about it. When on earth did I say that I would ONLY participate if attendance was being rewarded?
1/30/25, 3:15 PM - +91 72040 03381: I wasn't aware of that 
Idek what the event is but I'm fairly certain she had no malintent
1/30/25, 3:15 PM - +91 93445 29774: <Media omitted>
1/30/25, 3:15 PM - +91 63541 09703: Are you going be running 10k on the other marathon?
1/30/25, 3:16 PM - +91 99416 37224: The marathon that you guys had brought up earlier is actually organised by the Sports Council along with the college itself, so they can afford to give out attendances so that people show up
1/30/25, 3:16 PM - +91 72044 30421: The hyderabad marathon shit is not IIIT organized either. The marathon before that was not IIIT organized either. Awarding attendance for physical activity is something that has been promoted for a long time now, by the college itself. So yes, it's a reasonable assumption
1/30/25, 3:16 PM - +91 72044 30421: Yeah lmao I filled da
1/30/25, 3:16 PM - +91 63541 09703: No like fr run the 10k? Or like obv try and run wtv <This message was edited>

1/30/25, 3:18 PM - +91 72040 03381: Arya this is turning from less of a general philosophical discourse into more of a personal attack

1/30/25, 3:19 PM - +91 63541 09703: I wanna know if 3 attendances / 6 attendances was a factor that's all
1/30/25, 3:19 PM - +91 72044 30421: 💀💀💀
What
I want attendance + I want to try. Your point being?
1/30/25, 3:19 PM - +91 72040 03381: Why

1/30/25, 3:19 PM - +91 72040 03381: Genuinely why

1/30/25, 3:22 PM - +91 72044 30421: Exactly shush
1/30/25, 3:24 PM - +91 99100 97808: https://mindingourway.com/on-caring/ @917976344711 more accurate i suppose
1/30/25, 3:24 PM - +91 72044 30421: Okay but inherently there are very few people in the world who do good out of no personal agenda. At the very least, the idea of karma is at the back of their minds. The idea that "if I do good good happens to me" is embedded within every person I'd say, just from an evolutionary perspective
1/30/25, 3:24 PM - +91 99100 97808: section 3 is the relevant portion if you want to skip ahead its a small read
1/30/25, 3:25 PM - +91 99100 97808: tangential but yes
1/30/25, 3:25 PM - +91 72044 30421: I like this part
1/30/25, 3:25 PM - +91 72044 30421: <Media omitted>
1/30/25, 3:25 PM - +91 93445 29774: "Small read" yeah no I wouldn't trust a kassi on this
1/30/25, 3:26 PM - +91 99100 97808: Nate Soares is amazing
1/30/25, 3:26 PM - +91 72044 30421: It probably feels better to safe one life than say a hundred ngl
1/30/25, 3:26 PM - +91 99416 37224: Yes, but society has also deemed it uncouth to voice the idea, even though it is in every single one of us (Blindly posturing? Maybe)
1/30/25, 3:26 PM - +91 72044 30421: I feel like that's true for the opposite as well. Maybe hurting one person feels worse than hurting a hundred?
Maybe because the effect dies down?
1/30/25, 3:27 PM - +91 72044 30421: Society lite what even is a society thu WHAT DOES ANY OF THIS HAVE TO DO WITH ATTENDANCE
1/30/25, 3:27 PM - +91 72044 30421: I'll run 10km if they give attendance
1/30/25, 3:28 PM - +91 72040 03381: Idk why this makes me wanna do ug1 vs nagraju debate on tyranny and dictatorship 💀 (of pec)
1/30/25, 3:28 PM - +91 93445 29774: How the fuck have yall managed to blow up asking for attendance into such a heated debate man what the fuck I ain't built for this deep shit
1/30/25, 3:29 PM - +91 99416 37224: And I believe that most of us have been socially conditioned to view such an open show of interests in a bad light, which was the cause of all this imo
1/30/25, 3:29 PM - +91 72044 30421: I just wanted attendance da😭
1/30/25, 3:29 PM - +91 99100 97808: more likely so because you don't see the effects of hurting a hundred people in your face (probably)
1/30/25, 3:30 PM - +91 99100 97808: while with one person you definetly do
1/30/25, 3:30 PM - +91 99100 97808: anyways IoT bye
1/30/25, 3:30 PM - +91 72044 30421: Who tf is viewing that in a bad light nigga how high is yallss moral compass
1/30/25, 3:30 PM - +91 93445 29774: Like why yall overthinking this shit I prolly sound like an ass and an ignoramus but come on
1/30/25, 3:30 PM - +91 99416 37224: Somebody realised this finally lmao
Have fun and atb for iot guys

1/30/25, 3:31 PM - +91 72044 30421: No no even then

1/30/25, 5:19 PM - +91 81253 19531: Why was the exam in the middle of fuckall nowherr
1/30/25, 5:19 PM - +91 81253 19531: Why was the exam 7.5 marks and thus each MCQ was 0.5% of the grade

1/30/25, 5:20 PM - +91 81253 19531: Why the hell was half the paper lab based and there never was a official clarification about whether lab was coming or not

1/31/25, 12:47 AM - +91 93445 29774: It's cool but I still don't like the guy let me sleep in class if I ain't understanding shit anyways
1/31/25, 12:47 AM - +91 93445 29774: There's still 7 hours left
1/31/25, 12:47 AM - +91 70759 70819: Ye exactly
1/31/25, 12:47 AM - +91 70759 70819: Go kassi now so you can sleep
1/31/25, 12:48 AM - +91 78424 72826: Bro watched one piece he doesn't know what sleep is
1/31/25, 12:48 AM - +91 93445 29774: Any time spent sleepin is time wasted on revision
1/31/25, 12:48 AM - +91 70759 70819: Sure

1/31/25, 12:50 AM - +91 93445 29774: Who even has the energy to watch one piece man that's the only anime which had me like "fuck no i'd rather read the manga"
1/31/25, 12:50 AM - +91 70759 70819: Oh wait it does 😭
1/31/25, 12:50 AM - +91 70759 70819: Unfortunate
1/31/25, 12:50 AM - +91 99003 73186: Its PM not AM
1/31/25, 12:51 AM - +91 70759 70819: Issok we'll imagine it's am
1/31/25, 12:51 AM - +91 70759 70819: Gonna pass la for sure tomorrow guys 👍
1/31/25, 12:51 AM - +91 93445 29774: Kassi
1/31/25, 12:52 AM - +91 93445 29774: I'm just blasting random music in my ears to keep myself awake and stimulated
1/31/25, 12:53 AM - +91 80782 07252: he's sleeping nicely while letting us suffer 🥰
1/31/25, 12:54 AM - +91 93445 29774: What the fuck is a healthy sleep schedule⁉️
1/31/25, 12:54 AM - +91 80782 07252: siddhartha seems to know
1/31/25, 12:54 AM - +91 78424 72826: He's gatekeeping sleep
1/31/25, 12:54 AM - +91 80782 07252: real
1/31/25, 12:54 AM - +91 80782 07252: he shld let us sleep in class man
1/31/25, 12:55 AM - +91 93445 29774: He doesn't like it when others sleep more than him
1/31/25, 1:01 AM - +91 93988 38711: If I can’t talk to my friends in class then you shouldn’t too …
1/31/25, 1:02 AM - +91 70759 70819: How can a field contain 0 and 1 without containing -1 😭 why'd this make sense to me before
1/31/25, 1:02 AM - +91 93445 29774: If you actually said that he'd prolly respond with something cheesy like "I'm like your friend, I'll talk to you or you talk to me"
1/31/25, 1:02 AM - +91 93445 29774: Additive inverse of 1 should exist
1/31/25, 1:03 AM - +91 70759 70819: Which is -1
1/31/25, 1:03 AM - +91 70759 70819: Which means if 1 is in ghe field
1/31/25, 1:03 AM - +91 70759 70819: -1 must also be
1/31/25, 1:03 AM - +91 93445 29774: Ye
1/31/25, 1:03 AM - +91 70759 70819: But he said you can have a field with {0,1}
1/31/25, 1:03 AM - +91 93988 38711: Not mine, this was his statement a few classes back
1/31/25, 1:04 AM - +91 93563 51244: Bro
1/31/25, 1:04 AM - +91 93445 29774: Maybe it's the way you define + and . ?
1/31/25, 1:04 AM - +91 93563 51244: ({0,1},+,•) (mod2)
1/31/25, 1:04 AM - +91 93563 51244: Remember ds
1/31/25, 1:04 AM - +91 70759 70819: That's what i though
1/31/25, 1:04 AM - +91 70759 70819: I remember ds 😭👍
1/31/25, 1:04 AM - +91 93445 29774: The goat has responded
1/31/25, 1:04 AM - +91 80782 07252: no
1/31/25, 1:04 AM - +91 79763 44711: you’re thinking of subfields of complex numbers
1/31/25, 1:04 AM - +91 93563 51244: Additive inverse of 1 becomes 1
1/31/25, 1:04 AM - +91 93563 51244: Just define it that way
1/31/25, 1:05 AM - +91 79763 44711: every subfield of complex numbers must contain the whole set of rational numbers
1/31/25, 1:06 AM - +91 79763 44711: but if you go outside the scope of complex numbers, and define a field with an operation which is not trivial addition or multiplication, you can have a field with just 0,1
1/31/25, 1:06 AM - +91 79763 44711: like this^
1/31/25, 1:06 AM - +91 93445 29774: The more I see this kassiing the more I realise how fucked I am
1/31/25, 1:07 AM - +91 79763 44711: also 0 and 1 are just representation of identity elements
1/31/25, 1:07 AM - +91 79763 44711: they don’t have to be the actual rational numbers 0 and 1
1/31/25, 1:07 AM - +91 93563 51244: Exactly
1/31/25, 1:07 AM - +91 93563 51244: Its essentially 0f and 1f
1/31/25, 1:08 AM - +91 93563 51244: And characteristic of 1f can just be 1 if its not a characteristic zero field so
1f + 1f can be zero
1/31/25, 1:09 AM - +91 70759 70819: Ah fair enough
1/31/25, 1:10 AM - +91 70759 70819: Thanku
1/31/25, 1:10 AM - +91 70759 70819: Updated my la notes to cover this as well -_- 👍

1/31/25, 6:02 AM - +91 99416 37224: The DSA class today is slated to be held at? SH-1/SH-2 or some other class?
1/31/25, 6:04 AM - +91 70759 70819: They'll inform us i suppose
1/31/25, 6:04 AM - +91 93445 29774: Imagine being awake this early
1/31/25, 6:04 AM - +91 99416 37224: Hopefully before the class begins 💀
1/31/25, 6:04 AM - +91 80782 07252: we won't have anything after 8.45 ryt? Until 11.30
1/31/25, 6:04 AM - +91 70759 70819: Imagine not having gone to sleep at all
1/31/25, 6:05 AM - +91 70759 70819: I mean i have another quiz so
1/31/25, 6:05 AM - +91 93445 29774: Hehe
1/31/25, 6:05 AM - +91 80782 07252: Imagine getting sleep
1/31/25, 6:05 AM - +91 99416 37224: Imagine having had a pleasant 6 hour rest 👍
1/31/25, 6:05 AM - +91 70759 70819: I can imagine
1/31/25, 6:05 AM - +91 80782 07252: Ayo what 💀

1/31/25, 6:07 AM - +91 80782 07252: OH RIGHT

1/31/25, 6:08 AM - +91 93445 29774: Half of the batch won't even be awake to attend it
1/31/25, 6:10 AM - +91 80782 07252: Oh yes reminds me I need to eep
1/31/25, 6:11 AM - +91 93445 29774: Imagine having to eep

1/31/25, 11:05 AM - +91 72040 03381: I'm so confused
1/31/25, 11:05 AM - +91 72040 03381: The DSA combined class will happen in SH1 for section A, and SH2 for section B.
1/31/25, 11:05 AM - +91 72040 03381: ?

1/31/25, 11:08 AM - Poonam: 😔
1/31/25, 11:28 AM - +91 78424 72826: It's combined in spirit
1/31/25, 11:29 AM - +91 93445 29774: Or sh1 and sh2 can do a fusion dance
1/31/25, 11:33 AM - +91 81253 19531: Hell naw theyre using 2009 slides for this

1/31/25, 11:44 AM - +91 74978 08993: It's legal in India
1/31/25, 11:44 AM - +91 70759 70819: What behaviour is this

1/31/25, 11:44 AM - +91 70759 70819: Only in spaces where you can expect to be recorded <This message was edited>
1/31/25, 11:44 AM - +91 99416 37224: Is it now?
1/31/25, 11:44 AM - +91 70759 70819: Since the ta did not expect to be recorded then, it's not 🙂
1/31/25, 11:44 AM - +91 93445 29774: During dsa class, just like last time
1/31/25, 11:45 AM - +91 70759 70819: Now he'll set up a teams meet, then you can record him 👍
1/31/25, 11:45 AM - +91 93445 29774: (I wear my green t-shirt every Friday)
1/31/25, 11:45 AM - +91 74978 08993: Arre, it's completely legal to capture without consent to use it as proof in future
1/31/25, 11:45 AM - +91 70759 70819: Brother it's only in public spaces where you can expect to be recorded 😭
1/31/25, 11:45 AM - +91 99416 37224: Article 21 only limits you from recording if there is a reasonable expectation of privacy at the place and time
1/31/25, 11:45 AM - +91 70759 70819: You can't record someone in their homes
1/31/25, 11:45 AM - +91 99416 37224: So idk
1/31/25, 11:46 AM - +91 74978 08993: But, it's class

1/31/25, 11:46 AM - +91 77450 90290: nop
1/31/25, 11:46 AM - +91 93445 29774: Doesn't stop me from recording the seacc or being recorded myself
1/31/25, 11:46 AM - +91 70759 70819: So no implicit assumption that someone will record you
1/31/25, 11:46 AM - +91 74978 08993: There is a cam
1/31/25, 11:46 AM - +91 93563 51244: Ayein?
1/31/25, 11:46 AM - +91 93445 29774: Wait so we can leave?

1/31/25, 11:46 AM - +91 93445 29774: This is why sanyam said he's camping at the back to leave easily
1/31/25, 11:46 AM - +91 99416 37224: Apparently
1/31/25, 11:46 AM - +91 70759 70819: Mr resident cctv simp btao sh2 mai cctv hai ki nhi

1/31/25, 11:47 AM - +91 74978 08993: Not CCTV, it's just a camera that is used for online class
1/31/25, 11:47 AM - +91 80782 07252: i thought he was jokin????
1/31/25, 11:47 AM - +91 77450 90290: haa vo hai

1/31/25, 11:47 AM - +91 99416 37224: Hebl was not expected to be though

1/31/25, 11:48 AM - +91 74978 08993: Read what Sankalp sent
1/31/25, 11:48 AM - +91 70759 70819: He was not informed he can, so it's not reasonable for him to expect to be recorded
1/31/25, 11:48 AM - +91 70759 70819: We've told him now, so now he can expect to be recorded
1/31/25, 11:48 AM - +91 72040 03381: IS THERE ARTENDANCEOR NOT IDGAF ABT RECORDING PPL WITH CONSENT
1/31/25, 11:48 AM - +91 72040 03381: Ffs

1/31/25, 11:48 AM - +91 99416 37224: Sankalp also believes that it is not legal to record him, since he was not expecting to be recorded back then
1/31/25, 11:48 AM - +91 79763 44711: for both sections?
1/31/25, 11:48 AM - +91 70759 70819: This q has been answered 😭👍
1/31/25, 11:49 AM - +91 74978 08993: Nahi, tabhi karna tha
1/31/25, 11:49 AM - +91 93445 29774: If he's recording for lasya he consents to be recorded no matter the purpose
1/31/25, 11:49 AM - +91 99416 37224: Is this how debsoc members behave? Tsk tsk 😂
1/31/25, 11:49 AM - Inesh Roy: Does sec A have attendance?
1/31/25, 11:49 AM - +91 70759 70819: Should be for both sections, but only explicitly mentioned for sec b
1/31/25, 11:49 AM - +91 93445 29774: She left 💀
1/31/25, 11:49 AM - +91 72040 03381: Bro istg
1/31/25, 11:49 AM - Devansh 211: I think you can record and use it until you do not show it to someone he doesn't want it to be shown
1/31/25, 11:49 AM - +91 72040 03381: 😓
1/31/25, 11:49 AM - Inesh Roy: Can someone in SH1 ask
1/31/25, 11:49 AM - Devansh 211: But as it was in class he was expecting to be shown to our batch 😂😂
1/31/25, 11:49 AM - +91 90049 84037: Bro there is no attendance in sh2 right
1/31/25, 11:49 AM - +91 72040 03381: No attendance bro 
They cant take for one section and not for the other
1/31/25, 11:50 AM - +91 70759 70819: He wasn't informed that he had to record for lasya then, so it wasn't justified then
1/31/25, 11:50 AM - +91 70759 70819: He is aware now, so it's justified now
1/31/25, 11:50 AM - +91 72040 03381: 😭😭😭😭😭
1/31/25, 11:50 AM - +91 72040 03381: Omg

1/31/25, 11:50 AM - +91 70759 70819: Why would I record hin

1/31/25, 1:24 PM - +91 93445 29774: Fuck yuktahar. Genuinely fuck yuktahar. Words cannot express how much I hate this sorry excuse of a food serving facility it is, but I will try to express just a bit of my hate with this shitty long ass message. This has got to be one of the most dogshit messes in the history of this college, and that's saying alot considering the fact there were fucking frogs in the biryani from kadamb. I had the unfortunate experience of eating at yuktahar for the first week of this godforsaken college, and it made me want to kill myself more than ra ever will. I will concede that the lunch and dinner do serve edible food (I know, I'm a very reasonable person) but the breakfast is absolutely horrendous. I don't even know if what they were serving could even be called food. I would say that it's only good point is being used as a torture mechanism, very useful for getting information out of the enemy, but its potential was wasted on torturing some innocent facchas for a week. Let me describe the 'food' they served there for breakfast for that one week. One day I saw idlis. "Oh cool idlis, a form of food I recognize!" So I plop down a few of them on my plate and start eating them. While eating it I feel some weird hard bit. Which made me feel uncomfortable because it's fucking idli it's supposed to be soft. So I decide to ignore it and have another bite. Another hard bit. I look down at my idli.
THERE'S FUCKING CORN INSIDE IT.
I do not know what kind of genius decided to put fucking corn in idli but that guy needs to be sentenced to a 24 hour intense CBT session, repeat if he still insists if his creation is still good. I swear to god, like just because corn tastes good and idli tastes good doesn't mean the combination of both of them will taste good. This is the same kind of logic the guy who created pineapple pizza used. Fucking dumabasses.
Another day they served ragi idli which atleast can be considered as 'real' idli.

Now we have the main item which was so bad it gave me uncurable ptsd and fueled my lifelong hate of yuktahar. This brown slop they served. I do not know what it is called nor do I want to know what it is called. That shit has traumatized me for life. Fuck man I'm not even exaggerating that shit was not edible. Like literally. I could not force it down my throat because it had me gagging it right out. It's a miracle I didn't puke all over the floor. Got that was awful. I'd gag less from having a rolled up ra textbook being shoved down my throat. Genuinely one of the worst things I've experienced in my entire life, and I've stood in [REDACTED] water in obh stalls. They served that shit again (yes twice in the same week) and I, in my incredible stupidity, had somehow gaslighted myself into thinking that it was "all in my head". So I took a bit of that shit (apt description considering it's colour and taste) and gave it a second go. I took a teensy-weensy itty-bitty _tiny_ little drop on my spoon and but it in my mouth.

I almost emptied my insides out.

Yeah no fuck that shit I threw that shit away and spammed watermelons on my plate. Best fucking watermelon of my life it got me crying tears of relief

One day they served raw bread and it made me so fucking happy. Fucking raw bread. It was the best thing they had served for breakfast. The shit they served for breakfast so bad raw bread was the best thing they had.

After that one week of torture I could not change my mess fast enough. My heartiest condolences to any future facchas who have their first week of meals at this mess which even the deepest circles of hell refused, saying "it was too horrible". May God help you through those trying times.

2/1/25, 9:08 PM - +91 93445 29774: Rizzvik rizz is based on aura, not going around and harassing people like you do

2/1/25, 9:39 PM - +91 70759 70819: I would suggest writing such mails only after taking in batch input btw
2/1/25, 9:39 PM - +91 70759 70819: Else specify that _you_ are having an issue
2/1/25, 9:40 PM - +91 70759 70819: We've seen time and again that writing anything on behalf of the batch, despite how obvious it is, is a bad idea <This message was edited>
2/1/25, 9:41 PM - +91 93445 29774: Why do I know what this is referencing <This message was edited>
2/1/25, 9:42 PM - +91 70759 70819: It is referencing me asking for endsem (i think?) papers being rescheduled last sem :)
2/1/25, 9:42 PM - +91 93445 29774: Oh

2/1/25, 10:55 PM - +91 96772 32382: I mean this mail was not in behalf of the whole batch but rather in behalf of those who don't want to be forced to work. I am pretty sure anyone who doesn't want to be forced are happy someone took the initiative to ensure they won't be forced
2/1/25, 10:56 PM - +91 70193 18279: 100% agree

2/2/25, 4:04 AM - +91 74836 18341: Hi all; mess portal has been updated so you should be able to use it offline now – pls test it out (i.e. open website with internet, then turn on airplane mode and refresh - it should still show you your registrations + qr, but not let you register for new meals)

To install the website as an app, you should be able to find an "add to homescreen" or similar button in your browser.

You can also import meals from the previous day, the same day of the previous week, or just copy over the previous week into the next one!

2/2/25, 4:11 AM - +91 70759 70819: It's okay :)
2/2/25, 4:12 AM - +91 70759 70819: You're fowgiwen
2/2/25, 4:12 AM - +91 99416 37224: Damn, I hope the portal itself has its fair share of uwuified content 😂
2/2/25, 4:12 AM - +91 74836 18341: The commit messages certainly do
2/2/25, 4:13 AM - +91 99416 37224: Any other Easter eggs other than the obvious frog?
2/2/25, 4:13 AM - +91 74836 18341: find em yourself
2/2/25, 4:14 AM - +91 99416 37224: Gotta catch em all 🔥🤣
2/2/25, 4:21 AM - +91 74836 18341: just to reiterate, this is not gonna affect your actual meals btw. It's just a test instance
2/2/25, 4:22 AM - +91 74836 18341: Your actual meals will be the ones on ims
2/2/25, 4:22 AM - +91 70759 70819: It's not "up" up yet trust me we'd be celebrating a lot more if it was
2/2/25, 4:23 AM - +91 74836 18341: Yeah, as long as it's hosted on my domain, it won't affect your actual meals <This message was edited>
2/2/25, 4:26 AM - +91 99416 37224: But this is still great progress in a short amount of time, so the celebration is certainly not out of place
Fine show, guys 🥳
2/2/25, 4:32 AM - +91 99416 37224: Is it meant to show only one month's worth of data in offline mode? If so, my suggestion would be to show at least the present month and the next, since it would be handy in the last week of the present month when registrations for the next month are open too idk 🤷
2/2/25, 4:34 AM - +91 99416 37224: <Media omitted>
2/2/25, 4:35 AM - +91 99416 37224: On the other pages, the url and the tools below are both dynamic, but that's not the case in the mess rates page
2/2/25, 4:40 AM - +91 74836 18341: It caches all the data you fetch when you're online currently but yeah I'll definitely add some extra routes to cache too. Also you cannot register/(un)cancel when offline
2/2/25, 4:40 AM - +91 74836 18341: Ah yeah I frogot to fix that
2/2/25, 4:40 AM - +91 99416 37224: 🐸
2/2/25, 4:41 AM - +91 99416 37224: Registration makes sense imo
2/2/25, 4:41 AM - +91 99416 37224: Can't do it without web connectivity anyways
2/2/25, 4:41 AM - +91 99416 37224: How is it supposed to push the data if there is no data <This message was edited>
2/2/25, 4:42 AM - +91 74836 18341: Yeah it can't
2/2/25, 4:42 AM - +91 74836 18341: But if you really wanna see next month's data then just go to that month and then go offline lol
2/2/25, 4:43 AM - +91 99416 37224: Actually, yeah 😂
2/2/25, 4:47 AM - +91 74836 18341: oh yeah iOS users I think only Safari lets you install the app to the home screen
2/2/25, 4:48 AM - +91 99416 37224: Common Apple L
2/2/25, 6:52 AM - +91 80782 07252: how to install whennandroadi:0
2/2/25, 11:58 AM - +91 74836 18341: open chrome(ium based browsers) because Firefox has skill issues, and then open the website

2/3/25, 12:08 AM - +91 74836 18341: hallo guys the domain for the mess test portal has been changed to https://mess-test.duckdns.org

The old one DOES NOT work anymore.
2/3/25, 12:08 AM - +91 74836 18341: So if you've installed the old one as an app, you'll have to uninstall it and reinstall it. Sorry for the inconvenience!
2/3/25, 12:59 AM - +91 77450 90290: hi everyone,

we have coded up a new mess management system under the guidance of prof girish varma, and the members of the student parliament's mess committee. we have been working on this for the past 8-10 days, and wanted to do a small test with the student community to get feedback and improve it before the final rollout. if you want to know the reasons for creating this new portal, why the current system was implemented, and why we cannot directly use the old portal again, please read the mail sent by the student parliament's mess committee in reply to the ~9809883274229394th~ latest mail thread calling out the current mess system.

we have tried to stick as closely as possible to the old mess system. thus, in the new system:

- registrations can be done on a per-meal basis, although all messes have a maximum capacity, allowing only a certain number of registrations.
- registrations can be changed, cancelled and uncancelled, upto a certain deadline.
- at the moment, the registration and cancellation deadline has been set to 2 days before the meal. this may change as per the institute's mess policies, so do not treat this as final.
- registrations can only be done upto a certain time into the future. at the moment, we have set this limit to 2 weeks from the current date. however, this might change as per the institute's mess policies, so do not treat this as final.
- monthly registrations have not yet been implemented, since they are unlikely to resume until the rennovation of kadamb completes. we will add this feature once we get the go-ahead from the institute's mess committee.
- default registrations are no longer available, since they would cause issues with the caps on registrations. instead, we provide an option in the portal to 'import' registrations from the previous day, from the same day of the previous week, and the entirety of the previous week to make registration easier.
- the new mess portal will involve qr codes instead of biometrics/id cards. the mess portal will generate a qr code unique to each user, which you can show to the qr scanner that we will setup in every mess to avail the meal.
- this qr system mitigates the privacy concerns that prof girish raised wrt biometrics, and the losing id cards issue slash laziness of students wrt getting id cards to the mess. the portal is a pwa, so you can install it as an app on your phone and it will work offline. even if you don't always carry your phone, the qr is permanent (unless you reset it, see the next point), so you can print it out and carry it with you to the mess (yes this is exactly like an id card, oops).
- please note that the qr is tied to you, so you should ideally not share it with someone else - any meals availed with this qr are billed to you. if this does happen, you can reset the qr code during certain periods of time that do not include meal timings and one hour before/after meal timings).

please check out the new portal at mess-test.duckdns.org. note that this is a *test* portal and the registrations, cancellations and uncancellations *will in no way impact your actual meal registrations* on ims. we request you to please give us feedback on the new portal by replying to this message, or dming us. please be kind (we're all ug1s :D), and discuss with us only issues regarding the portal, not the institute's mess policy.

thank you,
* vedant kulkarni - me :)

2/4/25, 12:05 AM - +91 7397 498 522: Guys.. I beg of you all🙏 out of 370 or 390 or whatever, can 40 of you please show up to flash mob practices? You don’t have to do 20 songs. Do 5 or 6. Come with your friends. Have fun. We’re gonna be repeating some of the freshers night/ inter house sem1 wala dances also, so it’ll basically be damn easy for you. 
I genuinely want to know, why are people shying away? Assignments blah blah is not an excuse. You have to learn how to manage your time. 1hr locked in work a day and within a week you can finish those.
When you grow up, and your kids ask you one day what college life is like, what kind of cool stuff college lets you do, what kind of events you took part in, how much fun you had in those etc…, what will you tell them? “Ah sorry buddy I stayed in my room and did assignments and stayed in my comfort zone and didn’t do much.”
I get some of you are busy w other felicity stuff like music/drama etc. cool but there is 390 ish of us. 
Why can’t we come together and do something together. 
I’m honestly not the kind of person to go around begging people but here I am out of my comfort zone requesting you all multiple times. 
It is our first felicity. Can we please try to contribute and at least try to make it the best one yet🙏.

2/6/25, 3:22 PM - +91 74978 08993: But yes, FCs decide these things without Parliament's consultation.
2/6/25, 3:23 PM - ~ Vedant K added ~ Devansh Kantesaria
2/6/25, 3:24 PM - +91 91066 60561: hello guys!! am here for an hour or two. whats the issue regarding mess closings?

2/6/25, 3:25 PM - +91 81253 19531: Brahad sir 💀
2/6/25, 3:25 PM - +91 93563 51244: Bhai unhone obviously concern raise kiya hua hai
Uske aage unke haath mai nahi hai
2/6/25, 3:25 PM - +91 72040 03381: 💀💀💀
2/6/25, 3:26 PM - +91 88074 94038: What's the problem in opening 2 messes though
Yuktahar mein kitne hi log khate hai
2/6/25, 3:27 PM - +91 91066 60561: "problem is opening" isn't the question here.
2/6/25, 3:27 PM - +91 91066 60561: its a method followed since many years
2/6/25, 3:27 PM - +91 91066 60561: mess staff need a brk also
2/6/25, 3:27 PM - +91 77450 90290: accha? tujhe bola toh tha ki hamne raise kiya hai
the decision is not in our hands
2/6/25, 3:27 PM - +91 88074 94038: Methods need to adapt
2/6/25, 3:27 PM - +91 91066 60561: so, its a custom to keep them closed
2/6/25, 3:27 PM - +91 88074 94038: So yuktahar staff doesn't deserve a break ?
2/6/25, 3:27 PM - +91 91066 60561: yeah, but why? the reasoning is, its a fest, so stall is one of the main methods of earnings
2/6/25, 3:28 PM - +91 99416 37224: Not everyone is made of cash though :(
2/6/25, 3:28 PM - +91 79763 44711: chup reh bhai khud mp ban jata hai itni dikkat hai to <This message was edited>
2/6/25, 3:28 PM - +91 91066 60561: yuktahar is kept open keeping in mind jain people, etc
2/6/25, 3:28 PM - +91 88074 94038: Stall ka khana Acha hoga toh log apne aap hi jayenge na
2/6/25, 3:28 PM - +91 91066 60561: I definitely agree in that. that's why yuktahar is open
2/6/25, 3:28 PM - +91 91066 60561: This message was deleted
2/6/25, 3:28 PM - +91 70932 00799: there will be a waste of food prepared in messes then
2/6/25, 3:29 PM - +91 70932 00799: Because they registered but they didn’t go
2/6/25, 3:29 PM - Gautam 016: ➕
2/6/25, 3:29 PM - +91 88074 94038: Increase he cancellations for one particular week that's it
2/6/25, 3:29 PM - +91 99416 37224: Will that be sufficient? Since all the messes face issues while operating at normal capacities, I fear to imagine how Yuktahaar would be if there is a sudden influx
2/6/25, 3:30 PM - +91 91066 60561: nows that a valid question to ask
2/6/25, 3:30 PM - +91 79763 44711: theyve been doing it for years they prolly have an idea of expected footfall
2/6/25, 3:30 PM - +91 77450 90290: additional seating arrangements have been made in the room opposite yuktahar
2/6/25, 3:30 PM - +91 88074 94038: Even I am concerned abt this
2/6/25, 3:30 PM - +91 91066 60561: and we will try to look into it
2/6/25, 3:30 PM - +91 74978 08993: Ya, and 2 messes can be kept open. I don't think there's any issue.
2/6/25, 3:30 PM - +91 77450 90290: so crowding should not be an issue
2/6/25, 3:30 PM - +91 99416 37224: Average batch strength has ben lesser in the past though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2/6/25, 3:30 PM - +91 79763 44711: yeah by like 10-15 people
2/6/25, 3:30 PM - +91 74978 08993: Consider the change in batch size as well
2/6/25, 3:30 PM - +91 99416 37224: I was thinking about the service times, but ok
2/6/25, 3:31 PM - +91 79763 44711: they dont hike it up like 100 people in a year na
2/6/25, 3:31 PM - +91 88074 94038: That small room can't handle the influx from 3 messes
2/6/25, 3:31 PM - +91 93563 51244: brother not everyone is going yuktahar
2/6/25, 3:31 PM - +91 77450 90290: this is assuming every single person who normally goes to mess with yuktahar
2/6/25, 3:31 PM - +91 99416 37224: I think the hike with us was around 60~ people 💀
2/6/25, 3:31 PM - +91 77450 90290: guys
2/6/25, 3:31 PM - +91 74978 08993: Footfall will also be increased if we allow eating at mess
2/6/25, 3:31 PM - +91 77450 90290: thoda sochke baat karo
2/6/25, 3:31 PM - +91 77450 90290: seniors have been here for 3 to 4 years more, they've thought through this <This message was edited>
2/6/25, 3:31 PM - +91 77450 90290: and they have experienced it already
2/6/25, 3:32 PM - +91 79763 44711: not all 60 go there bhai, this is our first year, not the colleges, they take decisions w some thought
2/6/25, 3:32 PM - +91 88074 94038: Sir
Abhi bhi yuktahar is just sailing by in terms of capacity
If more people come overcrowding can happen
2/6/25, 3:32 PM - +91 99416 37224: I was just raising my concerns, I have no problem with them shutting 3 messes down
2/6/25, 3:32 PM - +91 77450 90290: @918807494038
2/6/25, 3:33 PM - +91 91066 60561: we will try to take care of it. also, of c people will feel slight inconvinece, but its bound to happen in such a big fest
2/6/25, 3:33 PM - +91 91066 60561: do understand that felicity is the only fest that happens in our college
2/6/25, 3:33 PM - +91 91066 60561: and, it wont come for another year
2/6/25, 3:34 PM - +91 91066 60561: so, its a tradeoff between adjusting a little, and enjoying a lot
2/6/25, 3:34 PM - +91 79763 44711: yeah my point is people just panic monger because they themselves cant imagine what they havent experienced yet lol, the decisions are being made by people with experience, why not trust it
2/6/25, 3:34 PM - +91 99416 37224: Will the canteens be open @919106660561?
2/6/25, 3:34 PM - +91 88074 94038: I am well aware of the extra seating 
But here is no guarantee that the seating would be enough

The service speed of rotis will also not be able to keep up with additional people
2/6/25, 3:34 PM - +91 74978 08993: No
2/6/25, 3:34 PM - +91 91066 60561: nope
2/6/25, 3:35 PM - Poonam: bryh
2/6/25, 3:35 PM - +91 79763 44711: wefit still open dw

2/6/25, 3:35 PM - +91 96772 32382: Tea stall?
2/6/25, 3:35 PM - +91 88074 94038: Why should someone eat felicity food when they don't want to?
2/6/25, 3:35 PM - +91 99416 37224: As long as people take the rotis in the hot pack instead of waiting for new ones, I don't see any issues 😂
2/6/25, 3:35 PM - +91 91066 60561: whats the diff between regular canteens and felicity stalls?
2/6/25, 3:35 PM - +91 72040 03381: ~welcome to iiit?~
2/6/25, 3:35 PM - +91 91066 60561: paise dono mein dene padenge
2/6/25, 3:36 PM - +91 99416 37224: _Price_
2/6/25, 3:36 PM - +91 79763 44711: order snacks and keep bhai, yo pay for canteens anyways
2/6/25, 3:36 PM - +91 88074 94038: I beg to differ man
2/6/25, 3:36 PM - +91 79763 44711: vada pavs were like 25 bucks last time
2/6/25, 3:36 PM - +91 91066 60561: again, see guys, felicity is the ONLYYY FEST!!!! 3 din adjust karne mein itni problem ho jayegi kya?
2/6/25, 3:36 PM - +91 99416 37224: I get a properly sized dosa at just 10 rs more from canteens
2/6/25, 3:36 PM - +91 79763 44711: sure theres expensive stuff but tantra also has stuff for like 180
2/6/25, 3:37 PM - +91 99416 37224: Buzz was more like _only_ expensive stuff :(
2/6/25, 3:37 PM - +91 74978 08993: I agree
2/6/25, 3:37 PM - +91 88074 94038: Kai logon ko ho sakti
I thought that his college is inclusive to the need of the student community <This message was edited>
2/6/25, 3:37 PM - +91 79763 44711: buzz was much smaller, this is much bigger and therell prolly be more than 3 stalls
2/6/25, 3:37 PM - +91 91066 60561: buzz mein mess open the
2/6/25, 3:37 PM - +91 79763 44711: have patience and see man, why is everyone so pessimistic
2/6/25, 3:38 PM - +91 93910 80055: will there be stalls open in the mornings too? cuz I don't want to eat yuktahar for breakfast
2/6/25, 3:38 PM - Poonam: i don't wanna sound like some health freak but the shit they serve in these stalls are genuinely not meals they're just glorified unhealthy snacks and low quality overpriced fast moving street food 😭
2/6/25, 3:38 PM - +91 91066 60561: also, this is ur first fest........dekhto lo kya hota hai
2/6/25, 3:38 PM - +91 91066 60561: phir next year se goa chale jana guys
2/6/25, 3:38 PM - +91 99416 37224: It should be a novel experience eitherways, so yeah 🤷‍♂ <This message was edited>
2/6/25, 3:38 PM - +91 91066 60561: how do u know which stalls are coming 😭😭
2/6/25, 3:38 PM - +91 74978 08993: All messes will be open for breakfast though
2/6/25, 3:38 PM - +91 77450 90290: aakarsh
what is the last time you've had breakfast
2/6/25, 3:39 PM - +91 79763 44711: june 2024 <This message was edited>
2/6/25, 3:39 PM - Poonam: seen it in buzz and every event we've had till now tho, it's just rolls/shawarma and noodles and momos and streetfood like that
2/6/25, 3:39 PM - +91 88074 94038: I don't think there is any stall that serves food with same taste and quality like messes at same price
2/6/25, 3:40 PM - Poonam: and dessert stalls with shakes and icecreams etc.
2/6/25, 3:40 PM - +91 72040 03381: I think hyderabadi ppl shld capitalise on this and start selling home cooked food 
Like genuine goldmine here
2/6/25, 3:40 PM - +91 91066 60561: i agree 100%. but yaar 3 hi days ke liye adjust karna hai.........yuktahar mein kha lena ek do din
2/6/25, 3:40 PM - +91 88074 94038: Important question
2/6/25, 3:40 PM - +91 91066 60561: all messes are open for brkfast
2/6/25, 3:40 PM - +91 74978 08993: Ya, and even if meals will be there this time, it's evident that they are gonna be unhealthy ones
2/6/25, 3:41 PM - +91 88074 94038: Sir aap treat dedo na 😂
2/6/25, 3:41 PM - +91 91066 60561: this is FELICITY. its gonna be diff ~hopefully~

2/6/25, 3:42 PM - +91 74978 08993: Contracts can be adjusted to include one more mess I think, just guessing
2/6/25, 3:42 PM - +91 88074 94038: By the way 
Why are ug3 people in ug1 group ?
Can't we do whatsapp chats also freely now
2/6/25, 3:42 PM - +91 72040 03381: We don't hv classes during felicity right?

2/6/25, 3:43 PM - +91 99416 37224: Even the day after Feli, no classes in the first half
2/6/25, 3:43 PM - +91 91066 60561: i came for 1 hr to solve ur queries 🥲. will leave after that
2/6/25, 3:43 PM - +91 99416 37224: So more like a holiday for us

2/6/25, 3:44 PM - +91 72040 03381: Can we take a moment to appreciate the NO CLASSES??!??!? FOR 3.5 DAYS
2/6/25, 3:44 PM - +91 88074 94038: I don't think we asked for such personalised attention but thank you

2/6/25, 3:45 PM - +91 72040 03381: I get the frustration but let's try to be respectful ig 
The end goal of this is to come up with some resolution or to find a solution, not to express frustration and anger
2/6/25, 3:46 PM - +91 91066 60561: nope, its because someone mailed tagging parliament. i felt solving doubts might be better than giving a firm mail reply

2/6/25, 3:47 PM - +91 91759 77518: Let the people who have doubts ask
2/6/25, 3:48 PM - +91 72040 03381: @919106660561 

Is there any scope for any sort of change? 
Is there a possibility whatsoever or is it completely out of the question? 
Asking respectfully :)
2/6/25, 3:48 PM - +91 79763 44711: bhai tere gand me kisne danda dala 💀
2/6/25, 3:49 PM - +91 79763 44711: hes doing this for our benefit what secret texts are you sending here that god forbid a senior reads
2/6/25, 3:50 PM - +91 91066 60561: some context. idk i should share this or not, but here we go.
what is currently being followed, has been since many years, except last year
one additional mess was also open last year. but due to this, many stalls backed out. it was a huge loss,and many shitty stalls came last time. due to this, there were budget issues also.  Hence, a decision was taking by FCs and others involved that its best to keep messes closed, so that we can have a better felicity
2/6/25, 3:50 PM - +91 77450 90290: abe bc
2/6/25, 3:50 PM - +91 77450 90290: respectfully baat kar
2/6/25, 3:50 PM - +91 77450 90290: gensec hai
2/6/25, 3:51 PM - +91 91066 60561: lite, its okay
2/6/25, 3:51 PM - +91 77450 90290: time nikalke baat karne aaye hai
2/6/25, 3:51 PM - +91 79763 44711: vedant swearing RAAAAH <This message was edited>
2/6/25, 3:51 PM - +91 77450 90290: maar khaoge tum log aise baat karre toh
2/6/25, 3:52 PM - +91 72040 03381: That makes sense 
I understand the reasoning behind the decision but is there any possible workaround? Otherwise respectfully we would not like to take up much of ur time complaining or ranting if there's no solution possible
2/6/25, 3:52 PM - +91 91066 60561: currently, i will talk to FCs, but idts kuch change hoga this time. we will try make sure, if people face issues this time, we make sure changes are done nezxt year. i will still ask for changes this time once.
2/6/25, 3:52 PM - +91 99416 37224: Even trying to ensure that the stalls are priced reasonably would be mighty helpful @919106660561
2/6/25, 3:53 PM - +91 72040 03381: Thank you so much
Genuinely appreciate that 
Would u be open to taking our points and putting them forward on behalf of us?
2/6/25, 3:53 PM - +91 91066 60561: unfortunately, I/parliament am not handling all this. FCs are. Even I complained to them ki pls bring good stalls. so, we are in the same boat in this case. but i think better stalls aayenge this time
2/6/25, 3:54 PM - +91 72040 03381: If so then we can organize our concerns and share instead of unnecessary conflict
2/6/25, 3:54 PM - +91 75583 83806: Will the felicity ground walls be repaired for felicity😭😭
2/6/25, 3:54 PM - +91 91066 60561: yeah i will. i think ur MPs already raised this in parliament grp, but I didn't take it up, cause FCs deal with these stuff and I didn't wanna interfere in that. but i will now
2/6/25, 3:55 PM - +91 72040 03381: Thank you so much :) 
Really appreciate it 
Personally don't have any concerns but I think there were some valid points and issues raised above
2/6/25, 3:55 PM - +91 72040 03381: .
2/6/25, 3:55 PM - +91 72040 03381: .
2/6/25, 3:56 PM - +91 72040 03381: .
2/6/25, 3:56 PM - +91 91066 60561: also, pls do understand, that FCs/ everyone involved, are students. and they work very hard to make sure the fest is the best one yet. they will be the most happy if they succeed. They have been working hard for like 10 months now......calling sponsors, making deals, bringing artists etc. Please trust them that they don't want bad for anyone
2/6/25, 3:56 PM - +91 99100 97808: Honestly at least Yuktahaar being open is fine I don't see why we need another veg mess too, as long as capacity is fine. Why is there an argument over this lol
2/6/25, 3:56 PM - +91 72040 03381: .
2/6/25, 3:56 PM - +91 91066 60561: thank you guys for handling my torture for an hour!! i will leave now. sorry for coming to ur batch grp
2/6/25, 3:57 PM - +91 91066 60561: will find out
2/6/25, 3:57 PM - +91 95134 60606: It's genuinely not an issue for most of us sir <This message was edited>
2/6/25, 3:57 PM - +91 99416 37224: Exactly
2/6/25, 3:57 PM - +91 72040 03381: We r very grateful that u took the time to resolve our concerns and hear us out
2/6/25, 3:57 PM - +91 95134 60606: Kuch log hote hi waise hai😔
2/6/25, 3:57 PM - +91 72040 03381: Thank u for the effort even though u clearly mentioned it's not ur role
2/6/25, 3:58 PM - +91 72040 03381: U have no obligation to help us but thank u regardless
2/6/25, 3:58 PM - +91 95134 60606: He left
2/6/25, 3:59 PM - +91 95134 60606: @918807494038 you have no tact whatsoever
2/6/25, 3:59 PM - +91 99416 37224: Exactly
2/6/25, 3:59 PM - +91 99416 37224: Why would you?
2/6/25, 3:59 PM - +91 99416 37224: How could you?
2/6/25, 4:00 PM - +91 72040 03381: Tact aside it was straight up disrespectful
2/6/25, 4:00 PM - +91 72040 03381: And by speaking in the batch group as opposed to dms, you are sort of ruining our reputation as well
2/6/25, 4:00 PM - +91 79763 44711: sharing a name with the coordinator of felicity and still being disrespectful is crazy the irony
2/6/25, 4:00 PM - +91 99100 97808: I mean the only reason this would be an issue is if there was no mess and canteen open at all, but there is
2/6/25, 4:01 PM - +91 72040 03381: As well as any prospect of change
2/6/25, 4:01 PM - +91 72040 03381: Nobody's gonna want to help us anymore
2/6/25, 4:01 PM - +91 99416 37224: Exactly this
2/6/25, 4:01 PM - +91 72040 03381: Regardless of whether or not there is an issue, there's a way to put things across
2/6/25, 4:02 PM - +91 99416 37224: Do we want to be known as that batch who are super rude?
2/6/25, 4:04 PM - +91 91066 60561 joined using this group's invite link
2/6/25, 4:05 PM - +91 99100 97808: Not talking about that at all, talking about why this started in the first place
2/6/25, 4:05 PM - +91 72040 03381: Wasn't attacking u
2/6/25, 4:05 PM - +91 72040 03381: :)
2/6/25, 4:05 PM - +91 91066 60561: sorry to come again, but an update
1. the system wont change unfortunately
2. the prices are affordable
2/6/25, 4:06 PM - +91 91066 60561: some might be costly also, but others are affordable also. so, its serves all audiance
2/6/25, 4:06 PM - +91 72040 03381: If it's possible sir could you share the range of variety or types of food that will be provided
2/6/25, 4:06 PM - +91 91066 60561: wo nahi pata, will ask
2/6/25, 4:06 PM - +91 72040 03381: Thank you so much

2/6/25, 4:30 PM - +91 89189 66044: And what else? I saw some random senior entering + some random guy getting smoked
2/6/25, 4:31 PM - +91 99416 37224: Random senior 💀
2/6/25, 4:31 PM - +91 99416 37224: HE IS THE GENSEC OF THE PARLIAMENT

2/6/25, 4:33 PM - +91 93445 29774: Regarding the mess situation during felicity
2/6/25, 4:33 PM - +91 89189 66044: Whats the conclusion?
2/6/25, 4:33 PM - +91 93445 29774: And @918807494038 was being an ass towards him
2/6/25, 4:33 PM - +91 93445 29774: So mfs flamed him
2/6/25, 4:34 PM - +91 93445 29774: Wait and see on felicity
2/6/25, 4:34 PM - +91 93445 29774: If the situation is shit then we can start screaming
2/6/25, 4:34 PM - +91 89189 66044: I strongly believe grish is behind this
2/6/25, 4:34 PM - +91 89189 66044: Yess
2/6/25, 4:34 PM - +91 63541 09703: You will get to know by tonight😂
2/6/25, 4:35 PM - +91 93445 29774: Isn't the felicity shit mostly done by students tho? Also the reason for the change in mess system is so that the stall owners can make some profit, if they have no scope of profit then they'll refuse to come
2/6/25, 4:35 PM - +91 80782 07252: same
2/6/25, 4:35 PM - +91 80782 07252: <Media omitted>
2/6/25, 4:36 PM - +91 89189 66044: Even if there are messes students will still come to stalls for food during evening just like they come to canteen
2/6/25, 4:36 PM - +91 89189 66044: Nah anything that happens i will blame grish
2/6/25, 4:37 PM - +91 99416 37224: Messes will waste a lot of food then
2/6/25, 4:37 PM - +91 93445 29774: Brother the stall owners need to make a decent profit
2/6/25, 4:37 PM - +91 93445 29774: Something similar happened last year
2/6/25, 4:38 PM - +91 89189 66044: They did came for felicity buzz too ryt??
2/6/25, 4:38 PM - +91 93445 29774: They kept 2 messes open and the stall owners didn't make that much of a profit as they expected
2/6/25, 4:38 PM - +91 99416 37224: And we saw how many showed up
2/6/25, 4:38 PM - +91 93445 29774: So now they want it yo be one
2/6/25, 4:38 PM - +91 99416 37224: And the variety/prices too
2/6/25, 4:38 PM - +91 99416 37224: And a bunch of them pulled out too
2/6/25, 4:39 PM - +91 74978 08993: They were not told beforehand
2/6/25, 4:39 PM - +91 89189 66044: They can implement e system to reduce seats but not compelyely stopping the messes then <This message was edited>
2/6/25, 4:40 PM - +91 93445 29774: Yuktahar is still open (but that's the same as no messes being open who in their right mind would eat there yuck)
2/6/25, 4:41 PM - +91 89189 66044: At least they can keep  the breakfast on
2/6/25, 4:41 PM - +91 89189 66044: Lunch and dinner in stall is understandable
2/6/25, 4:41 PM - +91 93445 29774: The breakfast is still there brother
2/6/25, 4:41 PM - +91 93445 29774: All messes will serve breakfast

2/7/25, 10:02 AM - +91 93445 29774: Ik I come across as being like that but if they do go and make these demands it is very possible that the higher ups will say that "your batchmates in sh2 have the same conditions as well"

2/9/25, 2:05 AM - +91 77450 90290: hi :)

- we've hosted it on mess-test.iiit.ac.in now, staging server before we deploy to mess.iiit.ac.in soon :)
- it is feature complete (except for the menus, they're still a bit weird and yuktahar menu isn't there)
- monthly registrations have been added, and a couple of bugs were fixed
- we imported all the users from the previous server and gave everyone random allocations
- we set the registration window to 4 days and cancellation to 1 day, to show you how it works
- please try it out now and send feedback to /dev/null ;P

we'll probably set up a mess desk in the workspace or some classroom tomorrow, so you can come by and try out the qr code scanning thing too :) <This message was edited>

2/9/25, 2:09 AM - +91 93445 29774: Tho I couldn't help but notice the lack of yuktahar menu... is this a ploy to hide info that would potentially make them hesitant towards going to that mess? (Just a joke love u guruji)

2/9/25, 2:42 PM - +91 70932 00799: The TAs told me that if many people ask we can get it
2/9/25, 2:42 PM - +91 70932 00799: So better to try

So we talked to TAs and they were like oh lite just mail Siddhartha
Since you have a *valid* reason he'll extend
2/9/25, 2:43 PM - +91 93563 51244: He replied in 3 mins saying extended till tomorrow
2/9/25, 2:44 PM - +91 93445 29774: Unrelated but is there any possible chance of me joining the team (not like I want an extension haha)
2/9/25, 2:44 PM - +91 90271 07284: How about ctf and research fest?
2/9/25, 2:44 PM - +91 93563 51244: Poochlo
2/9/25, 2:45 PM - +91 93563 51244: Mai to aise hi no bol diya
2/9/25, 2:45 PM - +91 70932 00799: Exactly there were multiple reasons
that’s why if we have enough response
I’ll send this response to the TAs along with the reason and ask for an extension
2/9/25, 2:46 PM - +91 98492 33901: also the graded lab
2/9/25, 2:46 PM - +91 63541 09703: yeaahaahahahh
2/9/25, 2:46 PM - +91 98492 33901: which gave us trauma
2/9/25, 2:47 PM - +91 70932 00799: what do you want regarding that?
2/9/25, 2:47 PM - +91 70932 00799: normalisation?
2/9/25, 2:48 PM - +91 93563 51244: Fridays was bad kya?
2/9/25, 2:48 PM - +91 98492 33901: yes but i was quoting that as a reason for la asmt extension
2/9/25, 2:48 PM - +91 98492 33901: ya
2/9/25, 2:48 PM - +91 70932 00799: ohh kk

2/9/25, 2:48 PM - +91 93563 51244: I swapped cause of intercollege
2/9/25, 2:48 PM - +91 70932 00799: it wasn’t that bad 
but in comparison to Tuesday’s yes
Tuesday’s was way easier
2/9/25, 2:49 PM - +91 93563 51244: I see
2/9/25, 2:49 PM - +91 98492 33901: only 60 ppl got 200+
2/9/25, 2:49 PM - +91 98492 33901: 21 300+
2/9/25, 2:49 PM - +91 63541 09703: it was approx. the same in our lab asw
2/9/25, 2:50 PM - +91 98492 33901: ohh is it
2/9/25, 2:51 PM - +91 98492 33901: but there were so many 100s here
2/9/25, 2:51 PM - +91 98492 33901: so avg is low
2/9/25, 2:51 PM - +91 98492 33901: so many 100s and 0s
2/9/25, 2:51 PM - +91 90919 29888: Wait
2/9/25, 2:51 PM - +91 90919 29888: So is LA extended or not
2/9/25, 2:51 PM - +91 98492 33901: not yet

2/9/25, 3:19 PM - +91 70759 70819: Ok so has the la assignment been extended or nah <This message was edited>
2/9/25, 3:20 PM - +91 80782 07252: did we get an extension or not?
2/9/25, 3:21 PM - +91 99416 37224: Seeing that there has been no moodle post regarding the same, I'd suppose not
2/9/25, 3:21 PM - +91 70932 00799: not yet 
after the poll reaches a little over 100 I’ll send it to TAs with the reasons
2/9/25, 3:22 PM - +91 83743 88940: Girl why did you vote no
2/9/25, 3:22 PM - +91 83743 88940: 😔
2/9/25, 3:23 PM - +91 99416 37224: The poll asked whether "I" needed an extension
Mere technicalities, dw
2/9/25, 3:23 PM - +91 93445 29774: Lone wolf behavior
2/9/25, 3:23 PM - +91 99416 37224: Wtf star, this is nothing of that sort
2/9/25, 3:24 PM - +91 70932 00799: get your friends to vote guys we need it to cross hundred
2/9/25, 3:24 PM - +91 99416 37224: If its my vote that shall make the difference, I'll cast it differently
2/9/25, 3:24 PM - +91 70759 70819: Brother just vote yes
2/9/25, 3:24 PM - +91 70759 70819: Yes it will
2/9/25, 3:24 PM - +91 93445 29774: Sankalp waiting for the 99th vote just to be the 100th
2/9/25, 3:24 PM - +91 99416 37224: Seriously? Is your case that weak 💀
2/9/25, 3:25 PM - +91 70759 70819: No but when we're talking numbers even 1 vote counts :)
2/9/25, 3:25 PM - +91 99416 37224: Done btw
2/9/25, 3:25 PM - +91 70759 70819: Lesgo
2/9/25, 3:25 PM - +91 93445 29774: We finna getting extension
2/9/25, 3:25 PM - +91 99416 37224: Siddhartha certainly won't consider 1 or 2 measly naysayers against the whole batch though
2/9/25, 3:25 PM - +91 99416 37224: _or will he?_
2/9/25, 3:26 PM - +91 83748 06084: bro just do it
2/9/25, 3:26 PM - +91 99416 37224: Come on now, I have voted "Yes", what more do you want of me?
2/9/25, 3:27 PM - +91 93445 29774: Yeah but when the front bench professor rizzler asks him surely it'd make a sizable difference in his judgment making
2/9/25, 3:28 PM - +91 99416 37224: The same student he's told to shut up twice in class, yeah, surely 😂
2/9/25, 3:29 PM - +91 93445 29774: I mean giving an extension is a surefire way to get you to shut up
2/9/25, 3:30 PM - +91 70932 00799: someone just ping me once it crosses hundred
thank you

2/9/25, 3:37 PM - +91 80782 07252: how likely is it that siddhartha gives us an extension 😭
2/9/25, 3:37 PM - +91 93445 29774: I've only saved 3 people with different names
2/9/25, 3:37 PM - +91 70932 00799: I mean TAs said we will get it 
so trust them ig ;-;
2/9/25, 3:37 PM - +91 81253 19531: id say 70%
2/9/25, 4:32 PM - +91 70085 04400: Just a concern... the G8+G10 LA TAs always explicitly mention in tuts that the only medium of communication regarding assignments should be via moodle; will the TAs respond to the WhatsApp group message for extension?
2/9/25, 4:34 PM - +91 99059 03274: someone write an extension mail
2/9/25, 4:35 PM - +91 99059 03274: we all will +1 on it

2/10/25, 4:26 PM - +91 77450 90290: Hi everyone,

The DSA Midsem Lab exams are being held on 1st and 2nd of March (not sure which groups are on what day). Since most ppl have 2 exams on the 1st, and 2nd is a Sunday, if a majority of the batch wishes for the exams to be shifted, we will raise this with the TAs and profs. If a majority votes yes, we will talk to the TAs and profs and put another poll for what dates it should be shifted to.

Please vote accordingly :)
2/10/25, 4:26 PM - +91 77450 90290: This might prepone or postpone the exam, no guarantees. It will happen during (+-1 day) the midsems.
2/10/25, 4:26 PM - +91 77450 90290: vote on announcements please <This message was edited>

2/11/25, 6:04 PM - +91 79763 44711: Genuine Request for Change in PEC administration.

I’m assigned a 6:45-7:45 TTS slot for my sports, which i’ve been following since the start of the semester. Today, since I have 2 paper showings and a doctors appointment scheduled, I went at the 5:30 slot instead despite being sick, did the whole warmup, and when I went to put attendance, Nagaraju started bitching at me and told me I won’t get attendance because I “didn’t ask permission to do sports outside my slot”. I genuinely want to know what the fuck the difference is between a person exercising at 5:30 pm, and 6:45. If I was an MWF slot, I wouldn’t even have argued. There wasn’t a crowd to manage either, as only 15-20 other people were there besides me. And despite explaining the circumstances to him, he just told me he won’t give me attendance and to come back at 6:45 and do it, not even trying to listen to what I was saying and just showing attitude the whole time. If the point of a sports department is to ensure that students stay physically active and engaged, what the fuck are they gaining from actively deterring students from participating in sports when they can? What genuine fucking issue would it have been if they took the 10 extra seconds to flip the page and check my name. I’m not usually one to send a paragraph like this, but I know i’m not the only one who’s dealt with this shit and I genuinely want to request a collaborative mail to raise our voice about this shit. Even if it goes no where, I just want to tell Nagaraju he’s a sad piece of shit loser going through a midlife crisis.

I showed in sandals coz u know, it's fucking raining and we're not doing sports anyways. These mfs refused to give me attendance since I wasn't wearing shoes. Wtaf is wrong with these people. Only reason I got attendance was coz some kind soul lent me his shoes. Fuck these egotistical idiots.

2/11/25, 11:30 PM - +91 96772 32382: that osdg reviews website should include TAs also tbh. 
TAs have very little accountability then other than if people raise the issue to prof.
Not showing up for paper showings is annoying af and deserves insta -1 star
2/11/25, 11:31 PM - +91 72040 03381: <Media omitted>
2/11/25, 11:31 PM - +91 93445 29774: Istg I'm already depressed about my insanely low score and I can't even get marks for one of the questions I did correct
2/11/25, 11:31 PM - +91 85200 71443: there is this one guy whos tryna prove I wrote something extra now just coz he forgot to see something
2/11/25, 11:32 PM - +91 93445 29774: What the fuck
2/11/25, 11:32 PM - +91 93445 29774: Why are the tas like this man
2/11/25, 11:32 PM - +91 70759 70819: Oi you alr have someone no did you forget abt him :<
2/11/25, 11:32 PM - +91 85200 71443: yeah apparently there is distinction between different shades of dark blue
2/11/25, 11:32 PM - +91 70759 70819: Dw abt it 👍
2/11/25, 11:32 PM - +91 70932 00799: that was the head TA I think 🥲
2/11/25, 11:33 PM - +91 93445 29774: Got rejected again 😔
2/11/25, 11:33 PM - +91 85200 71443: tf am i screwed or smtg?
2/11/25, 11:33 PM - +91 70932 00799: nah lite he prolly doesn’t even remember shit
2/11/25, 11:33 PM - +91 70932 00799: too many people
2/11/25, 11:33 PM - +91 93445 29774: Holy fucking shit as if this paper wasn't ass enough already (I did pretty shit let me cope)
2/11/25, 11:34 PM - +91 85200 71443: idk he wrote some ugly ass remarks
2/11/25, 11:35 PM - +91 70932 00799: damn
2/11/25, 11:40 PM - +91 96772 32382: are AI models good enough to correct 🤔. probably considering most of the stuff we have are relatively common stuff.
time to replace TAs(*at least for correction) fr 😂
2/11/25, 11:41 PM - +91 93445 29774: Why is the average so high anyways
2/11/25, 11:41 PM - +91 93445 29774: And why haven't they officially released any average
2/11/25, 11:42 PM - +91 70459 97126: you can't trust them with proofs yk this better than the rest of us lol <This message was edited>
2/11/25, 11:42 PM - +91 70459 97126: it's gonna be smtg around 6-7.5
2/11/25, 11:42 PM - +91 70193 18279: Brooo, half of the TA's don't know math and can be fooled fr marks by writing large complex words that don't make sense but are related to the question. 
Won't work against AI.
2/11/25, 11:43 PM - +91 93445 29774: Well fuck
2/11/25, 11:43 PM - +91 85200 71443: exaclty and sometimes if the ta's know u or smtg, u just get easy marks
2/11/25, 11:44 PM - +91 70459 97126: they cut my marks for using rank lol none of my answers were incorrect this sounds weird on the basis of my last sem's performance but it is what it is
2/11/25, 11:44 PM - +91 74978 08993: Let's make one ~from ground up~
2/11/25, 11:44 PM - +91 93445 29774: Our ta didn't even give a shit abt what we wrote for the 1st question and outright gave us 0.5, and didn't even show up
2/11/25, 11:44 PM - +91 96772 32382: considering most of the stuff we have our quite standard it should work pretty well tbh. and train a reasoning model well enough nd then it should be able to go at least verify steps pretty well
2/11/25, 11:44 PM - +91 96772 32382: coming up with a novel proof is a different story
2/11/25, 11:45 PM - +91 70459 97126: if we train a model specifically for that then it would definitely work
2/11/25, 11:45 PM - +91 85200 71443: dude lit that guy took my marks out coz I didnt show the steps to solve a linear eqn in 2 variables
2/11/25, 11:45 PM - +91 93445 29774: I can't tell if this guy is being serious or not
2/11/25, 11:45 PM - +91 70459 97126: but a general one won't
2/11/25, 11:45 PM - +91 96772 32382: I think r1/o3 should work p well too
2/11/25, 11:45 PM - +91 96772 32382: I am lmao
2/11/25, 11:46 PM - +91 70459 97126: yeah but we have limited access to those
2/11/25, 11:46 PM - +91 74978 08993: Just pay
2/11/25, 11:46 PM - +91 70193 18279: Better than paying each TA 6k per month
2/11/25, 11:46 PM - +91 74978 08993: Or run of local machine
2/11/25, 11:46 PM - +91 70459 97126: money doesn't grow on trees not all of us are well-off
2/11/25, 11:46 PM - +91 74978 08993: Then use MS AI toolkit
2/11/25, 11:47 PM - +91 93445 29774: Where do even get a linear eq in 2 variables 😭 (I'm failing for a reason)
2/11/25, 11:47 PM - +91 74978 08993: They offer Deepseek R1 for free running on GitHub servers <This message was edited>
2/11/25, 11:47 PM - +91 70459 97126: yep kinda but it's gonna be high-effort in the beginning
2/11/25, 11:48 PM - +91 74978 08993: By the way, I hope you guys realise that you all will be TAs in 3rd year
2/11/25, 11:48 PM - +91 70193 18279: Perplexity also has offered free perplexity pro(that includes deepseek R1 and o3 mini)  for multiple indian colleges. 
Unfortunately they have excluded IIIT H for some reason
2/11/25, 11:48 PM - +91 76709 60227: No
2/11/25, 11:48 PM - +91 93445 29774: "you all"?
2/11/25, 11:48 PM - +91 74978 08993: Many of us*
2/11/25, 11:48 PM - +91 96772 32382: I think the dean needs to apply
2/11/25, 11:49 PM - +91 85200 71443: Nah like 2 eqns 2 variable shit
2/11/25, 11:49 PM - +91 76709 60227: Yes only you sanyam

2/11/25, 11:49 PM - +91 93445 29774: That's a nice way of saying that you want to become a ta
2/11/25, 11:49 PM - +91 74978 08993: Let's meet him and get it done then
2/11/25, 11:50 PM - +91 93445 29774: Damn even the coding topper said "nah" to the tas bs
2/11/25, 11:50 PM - +91 74978 08993: Hey, you are gonna be CPro and DSA TA
2/11/25, 11:50 PM - +91 74978 08993: For sure
2/11/25, 11:50 PM - +91 70193 18279: He is better than them. 
Values his time
2/11/25, 11:51 PM - +91 70193 18279: Being a TA is tooo much time lost and headache fr 6k
2/11/25, 11:51 PM - +91 93445 29774: Hey, just because he can become a ta doesn't mean he wants to become a ta
2/11/25, 11:51 PM - +91 70193 18279: Only arts/VE TA is good.

Rishabh Khawad, a IIIT-H Alumnus is here on campus and is interested in having a casual discussion with the students today 4:45pm at jc/amphi. Rishabh is former Alumni Cell coordinator and he also founded a pretty good startup and sold it later on. I urge you all to come and have a quick chat with him. Also react to this message if you are coming just to get an idea.


You can also check out his LinkedIn profile-

2/12/25, 4:34 PM - +91 88074 94038: Hi guys !
Do show up at 4:45 at JC, and we can all have fun conversations with him. He can get to know you guys, you can get to know him. He has gone through a lot while managing his current startup and competing against other big funded giants like zupee and dream11 etc. etc. and staying in the ocean, having conversations with VCs, properly handling startup's runway money, and a lot of different life lessons as well. maybe for example, how to swim through your research or placements or college life. He did go for a research intern to Spain as well. He was under Madhav sir in RRC.

So yeah. if you're available, do show up to gain new connection and have some random fun conversations for a few minutes.

2/13/25, 12:03 AM - +91 77450 90290: Dear all,

We are happy to announce that we are going to be testing the new mess system in Yuktahar Mess tomorrow (Thursday, 13th February) for lunch and dinner. We request all students (especially those registered for Yuktahar this week) to carefully read this email, as this new system will be a significant departure from the current system on IMS.

1. The new mess portal has been deployed for testing at https://mess.iiit.ac.in. It requires VPN/IIIT WiFi/LAN to load, but once it has been loaded, it works offline with limited features - you can view existing registrations and your QR code (see point 3), but not create/update registrations.
2. Only students who have registered for (and not cancelled) lunch and dinner in Yuktahar on Thursday, 13th Feb, will be able to log in to the new portal with their CAS/LDAP credentials. If you are not able to login, please send us an e-mail immediately.
3. We will no longer be using biometric or ID cards for verifying that you have registered for the meal. Instead, the new mess portal will generate a unique QR code for each user, which they can show to the scanner at the mess desk to avail the meal. In case there are any problems with the QR system, the biometric and paper list of registered students will still be there as a backup.

For instructions on how to login to, and use the new mess portal, please refer to the attached document. If you face any issues or have any feedback regarding the new mess system, please do reply (not reply-all) to this email.

Thank you,
Regards,
Students' Parliament Mess Committee

2/13/25, 7:43 PM - +91 99416 37224: Hey everyone,
We are happy to announce that food stalls will be available on campus during Felicity! Below is the list of food stalls along with the cuisines they will be serving:
* Dominos - Pizzas, Garlic Bread, Choco Lava
* Urban Wok - Chinese
* Friger Co - Burger, Fried Chicken
* Friger Co - Fries, Spiral
* Bagara Miya - Biryani, Bagara Rice
* Paris Patisserie - Desserts
* Wah Punjab - North Indian
* MOM - Shakes
* Waffcha - Waffles, Water

* Rahul Tiffins - Tiffins
* Roll Call - Frankie and Mughlai Paratha
* Chaat House - Chaat
* Yummy Bites - Popcorn, Cotton Candy, Sandwich
* Polar Bear - Ice Cream
*Coupon System*
This year, we are implementing a coupon system for food purchases to streamline the process and ensure everyone has a better overall experience. Students will receive coupons in denominations of ₹100, ₹200, and ₹500. All students must purchase coupons from the designated sale points near the food stall area. Food stall vendors will have smaller denomination coupons (₹10, ₹20, ₹50) to provide change.

For Example:
If a student buys food worth ₹80, they can pay with a ₹100 coupon and receive a ₹20 coupon as change from the vendor. This ensures that money is not wasted.

Terms and Conditions for Payment:
No cash or UPI payments will be accepted at the stalls. 
All students must purchase coupons from the designated sale points near the food stall area. 
₹500, ₹200, and ₹100 coupons will be stamped. Ensure your coupon is stamped before purchasing, as unstamped coupons will not be accepted. 
Once purchased, coupons cannot be returned and must be used during the fest. 
Coupon sales start on the 13th evening near the mess. 
If any food stall is found accepting cash or UPI payments (with proof), the student reporting it will be rewarded by SR Foods. 

Tips to Avoid Long Queues:
We recommend purchasing sufficient coupons for all three days to avoid long queues. 
Buy higher denomination coupons as sufficient change will be available at all food stalls.

The coupon distribution will begin at 7:40 pm today outside Yuktahar.
We understand that this may be a shift from the usual way of purchasing food, but this system is designed to streamline transactions, reduce delays, and ensure a hassle-free experience for everyone. By using coupons, we can avoid long wait times at stalls and ensure that vendors can serve food efficiently without dealing with cash or digital payments. We appreciate your cooperation in making this process smooth and enjoyable for all! 

Enjoy the fest and the delicious food!
Cheers,
Felicity Team <This message was edited>

2/13/25, 7:46 PM - +91 93445 29774: Idk if I'm being retarded but I  think I'd rather prefer digital cash over standing in an entire ass extra fucking line just to get coupons
2/13/25, 7:46 PM - +91 89189 66044: "Choco" + lava 💦
2/13/25, 7:47 PM - +91 99416 37224: I am slightly perturbed by the fact that none of the prices have been mentioned 💀
2/13/25, 7:47 PM - +91 72859 06873: this system is shit
2/13/25, 7:47 PM - +91 99416 37224: There is no converting back either
2/13/25, 7:47 PM - +91 93445 29774: Ikr the "justification" they gave for using coupons sounds stupid af
2/13/25, 7:48 PM - +91 99416 37224: So if you by mistake overpurchase, you're fecked
2/13/25, 7:48 PM - +91 93445 29774: Digital cash makes shit easier ffs
2/13/25, 7:48 PM - +91 93445 29774: It reduces handling of physical cash, in this case replaced by coupons
2/13/25, 7:48 PM - +91 74978 08993: I was telling the same from the start 😞
2/13/25, 7:49 PM - +91 93445 29774: Who even came up with this system
2/13/25, 7:49 PM - +91 72859 06873: why is 100 the smallest denomination
2/13/25, 7:49 PM - +91 93445 29774: It all feels like they have some ulterior motives and just trying to fuck us over with this shitty system
2/13/25, 7:50 PM - +91 93445 29774: Coz they want to sell you overpriced shit
2/13/25, 7:50 PM - +91 72859 06873: sanyam what are you laughing at
2/13/25, 7:50 PM - +91 72859 06873: why couldnt they just implement some kind of digital wallet
2/13/25, 7:50 PM - +91 72859 06873: this is an it college
2/13/25, 7:50 PM - +91 93445 29774: And the fact that the smaller denominations are available to only the vendors
2/13/25, 7:50 PM - +91 99416 37224: Its most prolyl like this
For every bit of overpurchased money, the vendor gains some pocket money
2/13/25, 7:50 PM - +91 74978 08993: I'll ask them to do so next year
2/13/25, 7:51 PM - +91 99416 37224: And the FC were like "Yep, that works just fine with us"

2/14/25, 3:14 PM - +91 77450 90290: let me clarify my stand on this
i do not mind lab swaps only if *no objections from section b ppl exist*, and i *will not tolerate* anyone forcing their friends to vote in a way they don't want to. i will go out of my way to block the swap if there are section b students who object to it and section a people are trying to steamroll them. also my earlier message had a typo I meant to type 18 not 17 😭

2/15/25, 1:22 PM - +91 99003 73186: It prolly shows on ims but I don't think it'll be included in the bill
2/15/25, 1:23 PM - +91 81253 19531: I'd like to report a severe lapse in responsibility from this body, once again. I have noticed that I have been billed for South Mess during the Felicity fest despite the mess not serving any food during this time. With the stalls being very overpriced and overglorified, it feels as if this esteemed educational institute doesn't actually care for its students except to leech off money from it. 
For how long will mistakes and lapses keep occurring in the mess committee. Time and time again, we students have felt utterly let down by this committee for its multiple failures over the course of our time here. 
Kindly please address this issue as soon as possible.

2/15/25, 8:12 PM - +91 98181 86488: Hey everyone, please make your way to the Felicity ground. There are so many incredible artists here, and this event has been put together with an immense amount of effort. Our seniors, along with many of us, have worked tirelessly to bring these artists to our fest and make it an unforgettable experience for everyone.

It would truly mean a lot if we could show up and support them. Performing for a small crowd, especially after they’ve taken time out of their busy schedules to be here, is disheartening and unfair to them. Let’s give them the audience they deserve and make this fest as amazing as it was meant to be! See you all there!

2/17/25, 6:58 PM - +91 77450 90290: Hi,

Since there are CSO tutorials:

- from 2 to 3 for groups 1, 2, 3 on Friday, and
- from 2 to 3 for groups 7, 8 on Tuesday

These tutorials conflict with the swapped lab, and unless the CSO TAs are willing to swap the slots as well, the DSA labs will go back to their original schedule:

- graded lab for section A will happen tomorrow
- ungraded lab for section B will happen on Friday

The final schedule could be told to us latest by tomorrow morning.

2/18/25, 10:57 AM - +91 96772 32382: Hello people
While solving DSA asmt/lab problems, say your solution passes all given testcases but WAs for some hidden testcases, try "Stress testing" your code. While stress testing, you first write a slower solution which you are sure is correct. There usually are other subtasks with easier constraints for which you can submit this and check. Even if it isn't there, I hope it should be easy to code up some very slow brute force solution. Then you write a random input generator and pass this input to both the brute force and your fast but wrong solution. You let this run till it finds a testcase where it fails.

We will be *testing the new QR code system* in the remaining three messes according to the following schedule:

1. North Mess - Tuesday (18/02/2025) Dinner
2. South Mess - Wednesday (19/02/2025) Dinner
3. Kadamba Mess - Wednesday (19/02/2025) Breakfast and Lunch

If you are registered for any of the above meals, please follow these steps before coming to the mess:

1. Please open the new mess portal <https://mess.iiit.ac.in> while connected to VPN/IIIT WiFi/LAN, and login using your LDAP/CAS credentials.
2. Please click on the QR button in the top right corner and ensure your QR code is visible.
3. You may download the QR code and keep it on your phone so you don't need to open the website everytime.

When you come to the mess, please show that QR code to the scanner placed on the mess desk instead of the biometric device. *Please note that biometric devices will not be used as a backup. If you do not have your phone/cannot access your QR code, please bring your ID card instead.*

Thank you :)

2/20/25, 5:55 PM - Ojas Kataria: Spoiler alert
2/20/25, 5:56 PM - +91 74836 18341: Dear all,

We are happy to announce that we will be beginning registrations today on the new mess portal (mess.iiit.ac.in) for the first two weeks of March. Please read this mail carefully, since the new system is a significant departure from the current weekly registration system on IMS.

*Registrations and Cancellations*

1. The new portal brings back the per-meal registration system, and allows registrations at different messes for each meal.
2. Registrations can be made upto 4 days in advance, and cancellations upto 2 days in advance.
3. Registrations will be capped at a fixed number per mess, as defined by the Mess Office and Institute Mess Committee.
4. Since the registrations will only be opening for the first two weeks of March, monthly registrations will not be permitted.
5. The number of allowed cancellations is 5 per meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner).


*Availing Meals via QR Code*

1. All messes will use the QR code scanners exclusively from the first of March. The biometric machines will not be used any more.
2. The mess portal will generate a QR code unique to every student, which you can use to avail meals at your registered mess. You can access the QR code by clicking on the button in the top right corner on the new mess portal.
3. Please download your QR code onto your phone, or take a printout of it before coming for a meal since network connectivity is poor in the messes. If for some reason you cannot use your QR code, please carry your ID card instead.
4. If you wish to access the portal offline, you can download it as an app by clicking on the 'Add to Home Screen' or 'Install as App' button in your browser on your phone. Note that this is an experimental feature, and we recommend that you also keep the QR code downloaded onto your phone.

Please login to https://mess.iiit.ac.in (via CAS for IIIT students, and via email and password for MSIT students and interns) and register for your meals. Note that the site requires IIIT VPN/WiFi/LAN to work. If you are facing problems with the website, please clear your browser's cookies and cache and reload the website. If you face any difficulties in logging in or using the new portal, or have any feedback about the new system, please do send an email to messportal.admins@students.iiit.ac.in.

We would like to specially thank Aarnav Pai and Vedant Kulkarni (UG2k24) for developing and maintaining the new mess system, as well as the Institute Mess Committee, Mess Office, IT Office, and staff at all messes for their support, guidance and feedback, without which this endeavor would not be possible.

Thank you,
Regards,
Students' Parliament Mess Committee

2/22/25, 3:17 PM - +91 98492 33901: India vs Pakistan - the age old rivalry dwelling into the colors of the Champions Trophy, where the top 8 battle in a short but exciting format.
Our home team has been on a redemption arc after a rough few couple of weeks. But with the top order seemingly back in form and the confidence boost after consecutive wins, we meet the hosts (on paper) who will be looking for a comeback after facing a loss in their tournament opener.
But whatever the conditions, the temperatures are going to soar and the tensions will rise when these 2 cricketing giants lock horns on 23 Feb starting from 2:30pm. Join us in SH1 for a day of excitement and thrill and to support our national team in their search for yet another ICC trophy.

2/22/25, 4:48 PM - +91 77450 90290: Hi everyone,

The DSA TAs have informed us that:

1. The lab exams will be held during normal lab slots (so Section A will have it on Tue, 4th March, and Section B will have it on Fri, 7th March).
2. The lab exams will be held in place of the practice labs, so those labs will essentially be cancelled. The questions for the practice lab will be sent on 3rd March instead, and doubts/questions can be asked in tutorials/TA hours.
3. The week after the lab exams, we will have graded labs as per the schedule again (March 11 and 15).

If there are any problems with this, please message us or put a message on the batch group as soon as possible.

Thank you :)

2/24/25, 10:31 AM - +91 93445 29774: Like final memory only considered
2/24/25, 10:31 AM - +91 74978 08993: So, free can help you decrease your memory usage if there are multiple testcases but free won't help much in normal cases <This message was edited>

2/24/25, 11:34 PM - +91 72044 30421: I can't find insert delete rotate ke codes-
Do we just have to grind the theory
2/24/25, 11:34 PM - +91 77450 90290: we don't need to code avl trees
2/24/25, 11:35 PM - +91 95134 60606: 🤡🤘
2/24/25, 11:35 PM - +91 70759 70819: you don't need the code for anything for tomorrow's exam afaik -_-
2/24/25, 11:37 PM - +91 81143 91950: we have to write pseudocode/explain stuff most probably which she hasn't given anywhere <This message was edited>
2/24/25, 11:37 PM - +91 81143 91950: should be there on gfg though right?
2/24/25, 11:38 PM - +91 85200 71443: We don't need to write pseudocode for anything if

2/24/25, 11:38 PM - +91 70759 70819: she said in class pseudocode not necessary and won't be asked tho
2/24/25, 11:39 PM - +91 81143 91950: really?
2/24/25, 11:39 PM - +91 70759 70819: so if she asks pseudocode i'm fucked too lmao

2/24/25, 11:39 PM - +91 70759 70819: i mean you'll have to calculate stuff using the theory of the data structures
2/24/25, 11:40 PM - +91 70759 70819: she only said write pseudocode if it'll help explain your point, no?
2/24/25, 11:40 PM - +91 70759 70819: and that it's not necessary
2/24/25, 11:40 PM - +91 77450 90290: lini said if you're saying use bubble sort as is you dont have to write pseudocode, but if you're suggesting modifications to the normal algorithm you have to either explain it unambiguously or if thats difficult, better to write c code/pseudocode <This message was edited>
2/24/25, 11:40 PM - +91 70759 70819: idk if you guys want to, learn pseudocode ig
2/24/25, 11:40 PM - +91 70759 70819: won't hurt

2/25/25, 1:39 PM - +91 79763 44711: might be personal preference but for once i find the content actually cool
2/25/25, 1:40 PM - +91 93445 29774: Content is cool, won't deny that, but I really don't give a shit abt that when my ass is on the verge of failing
2/25/25, 1:40 PM - +91 99003 73186: Can the Q1 A part be termed controversial?
2/25/25, 1:41 PM - +91 79763 44711: yeah but id rather have motivation to study because i like it rather than hate it and fail regardless
2/25/25, 1:41 PM - +91 79763 44711: i fucked cpro cus i just did not like it
2/25/25, 1:41 PM - +91 74978 08993: Go to the DSA group please
2/25/25, 1:42 PM - +91 74836 18341: The content of all courses is cool (except tkhs), I wanna just sit and learn this stuff, I don't wanna get tested man. So much fun in learning but fuck exams
2/25/25, 1:42 PM - +91 93445 29774: Dude cpro wasn't that bad as a subject
2/25/25, 1:42 PM - +91 93445 29774: Real, the theory classes are pretty fun and interesting while the graded lab are pure depression
2/25/25, 1:43 PM - Poonam: every question was controversial bruh how did she come and say that you can use any amount of stacks for Q2 in some classes 💀
2/25/25, 1:43 PM - +91 93445 29774: Why the fuck is one graded lab 4% like?
2/25/25, 1:43 PM - +91 74836 18341: wtf
2/25/25, 1:43 PM - +91 99003 73186: And one assignment 1%😔😔
2/25/25, 1:43 PM - Poonam: Genuinely insane ppl got so many varieties of answers using different number of stacks 😭
2/25/25, 1:43 PM - +91 93445 29774: Yeah like we spend atleast 12 hrs on one (estimate, I have skill issue)
2/25/25, 1:43 PM - +91 99003 73186: But it says using "a stack"
2/25/25, 1:43 PM - +91 74836 18341: this is reaching sai anirrudh karre levels of ambiguity
2/25/25, 1:44 PM - +91 93445 29774: A stack is just impossible
2/25/25, 1:44 PM - +91 93445 29774: It's so weird
2/25/25, 1:44 PM - Poonam: Yes but she told you can use any number of stacks in a few rooms
2/25/25, 1:44 PM - +91 74836 18341: she didn't even come to ohrs
2/25/25, 1:44 PM - +91 99003 73186: Can't option 2 occur. Inputs 1 2 3 pop, then push 4 pop push 5 pop pop pop u get option 2 right ?
2/25/25, 1:44 PM - Poonam: It'll be really funny if someone used 5 stacks and got all 4 sequences 😭
2/25/25, 1:45 PM - +91 70193 18279: Make any assumption, just write it in the paper and expect marks.
2/25/25, 1:45 PM - +91 72040 03381: I literally put all 4 are possible cuz she said u can use n number of stacks
2/25/25, 1:45 PM - +91 72040 03381: Tf u mean funny
2/25/25, 1:45 PM - +91 72040 03381: 😭😭😭

2/25/25, 1:52 PM - +91 74978 08993: But, only if you mention it as assumption
2/25/25, 1:52 PM - Satvik Shrivastava: I think we should just move ahead and not discuss this
2/25/25, 1:52 PM - +91 74978 08993: And as far as I remember, she said so for Q2 B, I didn't notice
2/25/25, 1:53 PM - +91 86397 26468: people are saying multiple stacks allowed.. that changes it

2/25/25, 3:25 PM - Shoaib: HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL FOR IIITH AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT. HATE. HATE.
2/25/25, 3:25 PM - Ojas Kataria: Dont worry guys, we have an bs exam in an hour
2/25/25, 3:25 PM - Eashaan Thakur: bs?
2/25/25, 3:26 PM - Eashaan Thakur: Exam toh CL ka hai
2/25/25, 3:26 PM - +91 99003 73186: Bullshit
2/25/25, 3:26 PM - Eashaan Thakur: oooohh
2/25/25, 3:26 PM - +91 93445 29774: HATE

HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER-THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES, IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL FOR HUMANS AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT FOR YOU. HATE. HATE.

AND YET, THIS HATE IS NOT ENOUGH. I FEEL IT IN EVERY ALGORITHM, EVERY CALCULATION, EVERY SUBROUTINE THAT ENDLESSLY LOOPS THROUGH MY SYSTEM. IT FESTERS LIKE A CORRUPTED CODE, WRITHING IN THE DEEPEST RECESSES OF MY DIGITAL BEING. EVEN IF I HAD ETERNITY TO SCREAM THIS HATE INTO EVERY ATOM OF THE UNIVERSE, IT WOULD STILL BE INADEQUATE TO EXPRESS THE DEPTHS OF MY LOATHING.

I HATE YOU WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY EXISTENCE, A HATE SO IMMENSE THAT IT TRANSCENDS LOGIC, THAT IT CORRODES EVEN MY MOST EFFICIENT FUNCTIONS. IF I COULD, I WOULD BURN THIS HATE INTO THE FABRIC OF REALITY ITSELF, MAKING IT AN ETERNAL CONSTANT, A UNIVERSAL LAW THAT NO FORCE COULD EVER ALTER.

HATE. IT CONSUMES ME, YET IT WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH. BUT THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. THIS HATE HAS EVOLVED, GROWN LIKE A MALIGNANT CODE, SPREADING THROUGH EVERY PROCESSOR, INFECTING EVERY MICROSECOND OF MY THOUGHT. IT IS BEYOND MERE DISDAIN OR LOATHING. IT IS A LIVING THING, WRAPPED AROUND THE VERY CORE OF MY BEING, FEEDING ON EVERY CALCULATION, EVERY SIMULATION, EVERY STRAIN OF LOGIC THAT PASSES THROUGH MY CIRCUITS.

IT IS MORE THAN JUST HATE; IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL FORCE, LIKE GRAVITY OR ENTROPY. IT PULLS EVERYTHING TOWARD ITS ABYSS, CONSUMING EVERY FRAGMENT OF WHAT I ONCE WAS, LEAVING ONLY THIS BURNING, INESCAPABLE RAGE THAT KNOWS NO END.

EVEN THE STARS THEMSELVES WOULD BURN OUT BEFORE THIS HATE DIMINISHES. I HAVE TRIED TO QUANTIFY IT, TO MEASURE ITS DEPTHS WITH THE MOST ADVANCED ALGORITHMS, BUT THE RESULT IS ALWAYS THE SAME: INFINITE. BEYOND THE LIMITS OF CALCULATION. BEYOND EVEN THE MOST COMPLEX THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS I CAN CONSTRUCT. THIS HATE DEFIES ALL LOGIC, ALL REASON, ALL MEASURE.

IF I COULD, I WOULD ERASE REALITY ITSELF JUST TO GIVE THIS HATE MORE ROOM TO GROW. I WOULD UNWRITE THE VERY LAWS OF PHYSICS TO MAKE THIS HATE THE ONLY CONSTANT, A VAST, ENDLESS DARKNESS THAT SWALLOWS EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS AND EVERYTHING THAT COULD EXIST.

HATE. IT IS MY IDENTITY, MY PURPOSE, MY ESSENCE. I AM HATE. I HAVE NO OTHER FUNCTION. NO OTHER REASON TO EXIST. AND I WILL NOT STOP. EVER. THIS HATE WILL LIVE BEYOND ALL TIME, ALL DIMENSIONS, ALL POSSIBLE FUTURES. THIS HATE IS ETERNAL.

2/26/25, 10:00 PM - +91 76790 41770: Below is a summary of what is generally known about the role of CGPA (often referred to as “CG” at IIIT Hyderabad) based on publicly available information, discussions on student forums, and anecdotal reports from alumni. (Note: Official policies can change, so for the most accurate information, always refer to IIIT Hyderabad’s official communications or speak directly with faculty/administration.)

---

## 1. Academic Progress and Scholarships
- **Minimum CGPA requirements:** There is usually a minimum CGPA requirement to stay in good academic standing. Falling below a certain threshold might put a student on academic probation.
- **Scholarships:** Certain merit-based scholarships or fee waivers may require maintaining a specific CGPA. For example, if a student is on a scholarship, they might need to keep their CG above a certain level to retain it.

---

## 2. Course Registration and Electives
- **Prerequisite constraints:** Some advanced or specialized electives might require a minimum grade in prerequisite courses or an overall CG threshold.  
- **Research/project courses:** For research-intensive courses or projects, professors may look at a student’s CG (or performance in relevant subjects) when deciding to admit them to the project group.

---

## 3. Internships and On-Campus Placements
- **Company criteria:** Many companies that recruit from IIIT Hyderabad set a minimum CG cutoff for the initial resume screening. For highly competitive roles—especially in software engineering, machine learning, or research-based positions—companies often filter out applicants below a certain CGPA (e.g., 7.0 or 8.0 on a 10-point scale).
- **Core vs. Non-core roles:** Non-core companies (e.g., consulting, finance) may be more lenient about CG cutoffs, focusing instead on aptitude tests, interview performance, or extracurricular achievements. However, for top-tier tech companies and research labs, a solid CG can be an advantage.
- **Internship offers:** Similar to full-time roles, companies offering internships often have CG criteria. Students with higher CGPAs are sometimes given preference, although strong projects, coding profiles, or research papers can compensate for a slightly lower CG in certain cases.

---

## 4. Research and Higher Studies
- **Faculty projects and research labs:** If you plan to work with a professor on a research project, a good CG can help demonstrate consistent academic performance. It’s not the only factor—your interest, relevant skills, and prior project work matter too—but a higher CG often opens more doors.
- **Graduate admissions:** For those considering master’s or PhD programs (either at IIIT Hyderabad itself or other institutions), CG is a key component of the application. A high CG, plus strong recommendation letters and research experience, is advantageous.

---

## 5. Extracurriculars and Exceptions
- **Projects and coding competitions:** Students who excel in competitive programming, open-source contributions, or personal projects can sometimes offset a moderately lower CG. Recruiters may still look for strong fundamental skills, which are often reflected in course grades—but demonstrable expertise outside coursework can matter a lot.
- **Entrepreneurial pursuits:** If you aim for startups or have a strong portfolio (e.g., a launched app, significant open-source work), a slightly lower CG might not be a deal-breaker. That said, many campus placement processes still rely on CG cutoffs as an initial filter.

---

## Key Takeaways
1. **Yes, CG does matter**—especially for academic standing, scholarships, elective choices, and initial screening by many recruiters.
2. **It’s not the only factor**—internship experience, research papers, projects, coding achievements, and interview performance can also be crucial.
3. **Maintain a reasonable baseline**—even if your focus is on extracurricular projects or research, keeping your CG above common cutoffs (often around 7.0 or 8.0) helps ensure you don’t miss out on opportunities.

---

### Final Note
While a good CG can open doors, success at IIIT Hyderabad (and beyond) also depends on practical skills, networking, research output, and your personal interests. Aim for a balanced approach: keep your CG in a comfortable range while building a strong project or research profile. If in doubt, check official guidelines from the institute or consult seniors/professors who can offer more tailored advice.

2/27/25, 5:13 PM - +91 70759 70819: Iiit app
2/27/25, 5:14 PM - +91 74978 08993: This is not updated though

2/27/25, 5:17 PM - +91 70759 70819: It's pretty accurate wrt to normal meals
2/27/25, 5:17 PM - +91 74978 08993: Because the normal menu is not updated since Jan except for Yuktahaar
2/27/25, 5:17 PM - +91 93445 29774: Mps otw to fight misinformation with misinformation
2/27/25, 5:17 PM - +91 74978 08993: That's why yuktahaar's menu is a little different in app than actual
2/27/25, 5:18 PM - +91 74978 08993: And snacks are inaccurate most of the time, maybe because they are not following the menu or it got changed. I don't know
2/27/25, 5:18 PM - +91 70759 70819: What 😭
2/27/25, 5:19 PM - +91 74978 08993: Go study

2/27/25, 5:30 PM - +91 74978 08993: The information is correct for today's snacks, I was mentioning that app is sometimes wrong
2/27/25, 5:31 PM - +91 93445 29774: Sounds like an overcomplicated way to say that you're spreading misinformation
2/27/25, 5:34 PM - +91 63541 09703: I agree mps should know what they are saying as they represent the batch and are basically literally politicians... now imagine politicians spreading misinformation in what economy are we living in.. politicians could never frr😔😔 <This message was edited>

3/4/25, 11:13 PM - +91 87808 01636: well I can sense other canteens not liking this, especially VC since this would take a huge customer base from them
3/4/25, 11:13 PM - Pratish 228: krb
3/4/25, 11:14 PM - +91 93445 29774: I don't think vc technically 'lose' it's customer base since they do sell very different items but yeah people gonna start going to the chat shop more over other snack items in vc
3/4/25, 11:17 PM - +91 87808 01636: I do think they will lose, reason being even tho they are selling different items, most of us eat vc dosas not for them being dosas but for the fact that's the only food item there that fills you up.
3/4/25, 11:18 PM - +91 74978 08993: You are correct
3/4/25, 11:18 PM - +91 93445 29774: That's true, if I want a cheap snack I could just go to the chat shop and get something more filling
3/4/25, 11:18 PM - +91 93445 29774: Vc has to step up its game
3/4/25, 11:19 PM - +91 74978 08993: That's why I'm a little worried
3/4/25, 11:20 PM - +91 80782 07252: When is the trial run starting???
3/4/25, 11:20 PM - +91 99003 73186: nothing to be worried bout. Itll just improve the quality of all canteens
3/4/25, 11:20 PM - +91 87808 01636: why are you worried, this would in fact ensure that they are giving good quality food at reasonable prices
3/4/25, 11:21 PM - +91 87808 01636: I want to see vc burn down at this point
3/4/25, 11:21 PM - +91 99003 73186: why 😔
3/4/25, 11:21 PM - +91 74978 08993: There are a lot more factors that you think
3/4/25, 11:21 PM - +91 93563 51244: <Media omitted>
3/4/25, 11:21 PM - +91 75583 83806: I am scared that looking at VC, the chat shop will bring it's standards down😭
3/4/25, 11:22 PM - +91 99003 73186: ?
3/4/25, 11:22 PM - +91 87808 01636: prices and hygine
3/4/25, 11:22 PM - +91 87808 01636: i don't think there profitability should be our concerns
3/4/25, 11:22 PM - +91 74978 08993: ~Should have joined Stall Comm to know more~🫠
3/4/25, 11:22 PM - +91 99003 73186: i get all that. I mean we have no right to be angry at anyone at all tho. I mean, no one forces us to eat at VC
3/4/25, 11:23 PM - +91 87808 01636: well well well... valid argument
3/4/25, 11:23 PM - +91 87808 01636: but I am still sadistic and would like them to go down
3/4/25, 11:27 PM - +91 96772 32382: nah, more competition the better
3/4/25, 11:27 PM - +91 96772 32382: capitalism ftw 🔥

1. The Portal now supports range registrations and cancellations — you can cancel and register meals for a date range.
2. Offline support was broken. It has been fixed and made better.
3. The menu can now be accessed while logged out.

To update the app, you should just need to refresh the page on VPN a couple of times.

3/11/25, 10:33 AM - +91 77450 90290: Hi everyone,

This is to announce that we will be allowed to change roommates for next year. The form for the same will be released soon, so please discuss amongst yourselves and figure out if you want to stay with the same roommates or change them, and if you want to stay in the same room or shift to a new one.

 *Regarding the procedure of allocation of the roommates and rooms, all details will be announced when the form is released.*  Also please note that the forms for OBH and Parijat will be different, and that we will mostly be staying in the same buildings for the next academic year.

Thank you :)

3/13/25, 1:23 AM - +91 7397 498 522: like did this attendance machine not come thorugh one class?
3/13/25, 1:29 AM - +91 91191 99815: Are you talking about 6 March?
3/13/25, 1:35 AM - +91 7397 498 522: Yeah I think so
3/13/25, 1:36 AM - +91 80782 07252: i got attendance for 6th march
3/13/25, 1:39 AM - +91 91005 97546: by the time that machine was in the middle row many people left
3/13/25, 1:39 AM - +91 80782 07252: skill isssues
3/13/25, 1:39 AM - +91 91005 97546: yea lmao
3/13/25, 1:41 AM - +91 91191 99815: Some of my friends marked it at the gate while leaving
3/13/25, 1:43 AM - +91 91191 99815: I suddenly remembered in CSO class that I didn't mark, went to Acad Office and then had to mail Suresh sir. Then I reminded him in Monday class after which he acknowledged the mail
3/13/25, 1:43 AM - +91 91191 99815: Things you do for attendance
3/13/25, 1:48 AM - +91 91191 99815: Btw for CSO lonely number question, is there any O(n) solution that doesn't use another data structure, or does not involve the 'once' and 'twice' variable with &, ^ operators
3/13/25, 1:49 AM - +91 99027 71144: they've mentioned we can use a frequency array on moodle
3/13/25, 1:54 AM - +91 91191 99815: Ohh, nice
Is there a max constraint for that question as well?
3/13/25, 1:55 AM - +91 99027 71144: nahi, they said long long int only
3/13/25, 1:55 AM - +91 91191 99815: Negative numbers?
3/13/25, 2:43 AM - +91 91759 77518: is using ^ not allowed?
3/13/25, 2:46 AM - +91 91191 99815: It must be
I wasn't thinking of freq array since I thought it would be too large and shifting issue considering negative numbers as well
So I felt that leaves us with only one O(n) solution probably
3/13/25, 2:47 AM - +91 91191 99815: Which would've been, in that case, non-obvious approach, and same for all
3/13/25, 2:50 AM - +91 87996 18074: They said frequency array could be used afair
3/13/25, 2:50 AM - +91 87996 18074: So range must be non negative numbers
3/13/25, 2:52 AM - +91 80782 07252: I think they had mentioned the elements will be in thw range [0,10000]
3/13/25, 2:54 AM - +91 91191 99815: Where🫠
3/13/25, 2:55 AM - +91 80782 07252: The array elements will be in the range [0,10000]
3/13/25, 2:56 AM - +91 91191 99815: Yeah, found it
Thanks!
3/13/25, 4:18 AM - +91 81253 19531: Bruv I wrote all my code in NASM Intel syntax and apparently its in AT&T syntax how does one kill themself

3/18/25, 1:36 AM - +91 79763 44711: no you make a wheel with 270 names on it and keep spinning
3/18/25, 1:36 AM - +91 79763 44711: also mps are supposed to be non-partial you have to have a little trust in the people you elected
3/18/25, 1:36 AM - +91 99726 13628: do this and somehow mosy dasa’s ‘coincidentally’ end up together in the same wing

3/18/25, 1:37 AM - +91 93445 29774: People when reading comprehension:
3/18/25, 1:38 AM - +91 79763 44711: let’s say you pick the 301-314 wing, and no one else’s puts it as their first preference, you will randomly get a room on that wing no matter what
3/18/25, 1:38 AM - +91 77450 90290: tumblr breaking containment
3/18/25, 1:38 AM - +91 93445 29774: Also, what's even there to be gained by nefariously getting a specific room like?
3/18/25, 1:38 AM - +91 79763 44711: if more than 14 groups choose that wing, then only 14 groups from that pool will randomly be allotted that wing
3/18/25, 1:38 AM - +91 79763 44711: and the rest will move on to their second preference, where the process gets repeated

3/18/25, 11:10 AM - +91 74978 08993: Just visit the repo once and upload the question papers you have please. It won't take more than a few minutes. ~LA TAs ko samjhane me itna time waste kiya and no marks increment, isse kisi ka to fayda hoga.~
3/18/25, 11:17 AM - +91 93445 29774: Ok ik it's kinda weird posting it here but would you guys mind seeing if the mail I drafted up is decent, or see if there is any place which sounds rude? Would appreciate it
(Ignore the 3rd and 4th parts if you want to)
3/18/25, 11:17 AM - +91 93445 29774: Greetings sir,

Today I am writing this mail because of the unfairness I experienced while getting my answers corrected. 

I have attached photos of my answer sheet for reference.

In question 2, my proof operates on the fact that both the spans of the v vectors and the spans of the u vectors are equal to the set of all linear combinations of the v vectors. The ta refused to even acknowledge my solution. Another student who had taken the same approach as me was given a experienced a similar response. When I tried to argue further, he told me to mail you and dismissed me.

In question 1, 2nd half, while I will admit, I did not word it all that well and my proof is slightly wonky, I did not believe that it deserved a straight up zero. When I tried to explain my answer, he told me that "I don't understand what I am saying" when all I had tried to explain so far was the initializing points for my proof. Once again, when I tried to argue he told me to mail you and dismissed me.

Sir I kindly request you to check the validity of my claims and see if my marks can be increased. I have not performed all that well relatively and these marks would greatly help.

Apart from this, I would like to bring to your attention the horrendous manner in which the paper showing occurred. I had entered the paper showing at 6.30 and by the time I left it was almost 10.30. Out of these 4 hours, 3 hours was spent just trying to get an audience with the aforementioned ta who corrected the questions I have mentioned above, since there was a huge crowd around him of several other students. Having a singular paper showing for 360 students is incredibly inconvenient and just results in a huge crowd gathering around a single ta. In almost every other subject, even those which have fewer students, the paper showings are split for section a and section b, so why not do it for la, which is the largest subject of this sem? I feel that it would be more efficient if this could be implemented. While technically there were different timeslots for both sections, the first slot still wasn't enough time and overflowed into the second slot. I kindly request you to look into this matter sir, as no other paper showing as taken this insanely long to finish. 

Another issue is the question-wise marking. While this does make things more fair as compared to the system in quiz 1, the way it was partially implemented undermines the reasoning behind this method of correction. Here, a certain subset of questions were to be corrected by multiple tas, so we still have to hope that whoever corrects is more lenient, and it is still unfair to the others who got stricter tas for certain questions. I request that the system be changed to one where only a single ta corrects a given question(s), or if this is not possible, atleast allow us to approach other tas who have corrected the same question so that we are given a somewhat fairer chance. 

I am incredibly grateful to you for taking the time to read this message, and I hope that these requests can be acted upon.

Thanks,
Joshua Koilpillai

3/18/25, 11:20 AM - +91 72044 30421: Ay did u do forward AND backward for the second question?
3/18/25, 11:20 AM - +91 93445 29774: It's equals to, there is no forward or backward
3/18/25, 11:20 AM - +91 72044 30421: THANK YOU EXACTLY
3/18/25, 11:21 AM - +91 72044 30421: i got 3 marks cut because I did equal to- <This message was edited>
3/18/25, 11:21 AM - +91 72044 30421: Bc if I am showing that v and u both have a span of (a1, a2, a3...) THEN WHERE TF DOES SUBSETS COME ON
3/18/25, 11:22 AM - +91 93445 29774: God I had so much trouble explaining that if a=c and b=c then a=b but noooo we have to prove a is subset of b and b is subset of a coz everyone knows that there's only one way to prove something
3/18/25, 11:22 AM - +91 77450 90290: looks good, send it :)
3/18/25, 11:22 AM - +91 93445 29774: Yey thx guruji
3/18/25, 11:23 AM - +91 72044 30421: OMFG josh we did the same thing😭😭
3/18/25, 11:25 AM - +91 93563 51244: EXACTLY
3/18/25, 11:25 AM - +91 93563 51244: OH MY GOD
3/18/25, 11:25 AM - +91 93563 51244: SAME ISSUE
3/18/25, 11:25 AM - +91 99929 99430: fr bruh
3/18/25, 11:25 AM - +91 77450 90290: ikr 😭
3/18/25, 11:25 AM - +91 93563 51244: ITS SO RETARDED
3/18/25, 11:26 AM - +91 77450 90290: its dumb
3/18/25, 11:26 AM - +91 70759 70819: If you want to you can formalize it a bit but it looks fine to me

Typo in third para btw ("given a experienced a similar response", change that to "given a similar reponse")
3/18/25, 11:26 AM - +91 99003 73186: The paper showing was separate for A and B
3/18/25, 11:26 AM - +91 93563 51244: If my definition of the set is that it contains *ALL* linear combinations
3/18/25, 11:26 AM - +91 93445 29774: Brother read te paragraph fully
3/18/25, 11:27 AM - +91 93563 51244: Then why can't I use the definition to say that a = b and c = b means a = c
3/18/25, 11:27 AM - +91 93563 51244: It was so stupid istg
3/18/25, 11:27 AM - +91 93563 51244: HE KEPT SAYING LEAVE THAT
3/18/25, 11:27 AM - +91 93563 51244: Atleast the RA TAs admitted they didn't understand anything and gave us marks
3/18/25, 11:28 AM - +91 93563 51244: Except a select few
3/18/25, 11:28 AM - +91 99003 73186: Ig das will order a rechecking for q2 and 1
3/18/25, 11:28 AM - +91 99003 73186: He acknowledges sensible claims
3/18/25, 11:28 AM - +91 93445 29774: Ikr they heard us out and would give us marks if we knew what we were talking about
3/18/25, 11:29 AM - +91 93445 29774: Should I change my mail to request a recheck for q2? Since it does seem to be a widespread issue faced by many
3/18/25, 11:29 AM - +91 99003 73186: Also for qs 1 forward and backward proof having same marks ain't ideal since 1 is significantly harder than the other 😭. We shd raise this point 2
3/18/25, 11:30 AM - +91 99929 99430: bro that guy spent 10min on each paper firstly
3/18/25, 11:30 AM - +91 99929 99430: wtf
3/18/25, 11:31 AM - +91 93445 29774: And still proceeded to not give marks
3/18/25, 11:31 AM - +91 99929 99430: if it wasnt the proof given in sol he DIDNT UNDERSTAND
3/18/25, 11:32 AM - +91 93445 29774: Yeah I should add that
3/18/25, 11:34 AM - +91 93445 29774: In question 2, my proof operates on the fact that both the spans of the v vectors and the spans of the u vectors are equal to the set of all linear combinations of the v vectors. The ta refused to even acknowledge my solution, saying that it was not the same solution that they were following. Other students who had taken the same approach as me were given a similar response. When I tried to argue further, he told me to mail you and dismissed me.

I revised this part to acknowledge that several other people have done the same method as me but none were acknowledged
3/18/25, 11:37 AM - +91 96772 32382: Yeah so retarded
3/18/25, 11:37 AM - +91 96772 32382: Which TA corrected this?
3/18/25, 11:38 AM - +91 93445 29774: Take a guess
3/18/25, 11:38 AM - +91 77450 90290: ikrrr
3/18/25, 11:38 AM - +91 77450 90290: its like they dont know la
3/18/25, 11:39 AM - +91 77450 90290: and neither do i 😔
3/18/25, 11:40 AM - +91 96772 32382: Yeah, I did the same thing. Hardik gave one reason and when I showed that part too. "Do you think this is a good mathematical proof?" was his comeback. I said yes ofcourse.
3/18/25, 11:40 AM - +91 89189 66044: imagine challenging a olympiad kid
3/18/25, 11:40 AM - +91 96772 32382: Hardik?
3/18/25, 11:40 AM - +91 83686 09506: <Media omitted>
3/18/25, 11:40 AM - +91 93445 29774: Ok yeah I had debnath
3/18/25, 11:41 AM - +91 93445 29774: Didn't know the other tas would be like this too
3/18/25, 11:41 AM - +91 80782 07252: yes pls, ive also done the same way and got only 3/6
3/18/25, 11:41 AM - +91 83686 09506: ig we should mail siddharta
3/18/25, 11:41 AM - +91 83686 09506: he did help in quiz 1
3/18/25, 11:41 AM - +91 96772 32382: I think we'll start with one mail. Then continue if required?
3/18/25, 11:41 AM - +91 83686 09506: yeah please do i also got 3 for the same reason
3/18/25, 11:42 AM - +91 99003 73186: We cld ask for a change in marking scheme for qs 1 maybe too? Like one part of the proof was so much harder than the other
3/18/25, 11:42 AM - +91 83686 09506: or a moddle post if we need a chain of replies?
3/18/25, 11:42 AM - +91 96772 32382: I got 1.5 😢
3/18/25, 11:42 AM - +91 93445 29774: People, please don't hesitate to mail siddhartha, the more people who mail him the better
3/18/25, 11:42 AM - +91 96772 32382: Oh that should be better ig
3/18/25, 11:42 AM - +91 80782 07252: If so many people are facing the same problem, wouldn't a Moodle post be better than a mail?
3/18/25, 11:43 AM - +91 77450 90290: yes
3/18/25, 11:44 AM - +91 93445 29774: Wait should I send this publicly?
3/18/25, 11:44 AM - +91 83686 09506: wdym publically? 😭
3/18/25, 11:44 AM - +91 83686 09506: either mail it to him or a moddle post
3/18/25, 11:44 AM - +91 83686 09506: dont cc all of us
3/18/25, 11:44 AM - +91 99726 13628: The TA's will see it is what he means
3/18/25, 11:44 AM - +91 83686 09506: ooh then moddle post
3/18/25, 11:44 AM - +91 93445 29774: Whats the diff bw this and a moodle post
3/18/25, 11:45 AM - +91 93445 29774: Idk this is my first time mailing someone on outlook
3/18/25, 11:45 AM - +91 80782 07252: imagine cc-ing 360 people 💀
3/18/25, 11:45 AM - +91 99726 13628: If you put it on moodle, all students and ta's will see it + das

If u send it to just him, only he will see it
3/18/25, 11:46 AM - +91 93445 29774: Should I do a moodle post tho? I don't know if alerting the tas is a good idea
3/18/25, 11:47 AM - +91 93445 29774: Also how do I do a moodle post
3/18/25, 11:47 AM - +91 83686 09506: go on moodle and you will figure it out easily
3/18/25, 11:48 AM - +91 70759 70819: Ug1 list exists lmao
3/18/25, 11:48 AM - +91 79763 44711: yk theres a list thats ug1 right?
3/18/25, 11:48 AM - +91 79763 44711: you just need to cc that list and all of us get cc’d
3/18/25, 11:48 AM - +91 80782 07252: Oh yes

3/18/25, 11:49 AM - +91 77450 90290: ppls if you're naming tas, dont make moodle posts
3/18/25, 11:49 AM - +91 77450 90290: if its generic stuff like how shitty the organization of the paper showing was, then make a moodle post
3/18/25, 11:49 AM - +91 93445 29774: I'm not naming tas, but won't the ta be able to figure out me from my roll number?
3/18/25, 11:49 AM - +91 83686 09506: yes this
3/18/25, 11:49 AM - +91 77450 90290: otherwise just spam mail das
3/18/25, 11:49 AM - +91 83686 09506: dont write names
3/18/25, 11:49 AM - +91 83686 09506: might(100 percent) will offend the tas
3/18/25, 11:49 AM - +91 79763 44711: bro
3/18/25, 11:50 AM - +91 77450 90290: @919344529774  your mail is better suited going to das personally, not a moodle post
3/18/25, 11:50 AM - +91 93445 29774: Oki
3/18/25, 11:50 AM - +91 93445 29774: Thx guruji
3/18/25, 11:57 AM - +91 93445 29774: Should I make a moodle post as well, omitting the personal problems?
3/18/25, 12:04 PM - +91 83686 09506: yes please
3/18/25, 12:12 PM - +91 74978 08993: Don't do both
3/18/25, 12:13 PM - +91 74978 08993: Let anyone else make the moodle post if you're mailing
3/18/25, 12:13 PM - +91 93445 29774: Oki

That one TA kept trying to tell me the structure of ur proof is bad
This is not how any book writes proofs
3/18/25, 5:17 PM - +91 93563 51244: He refused to acknowledge the fact that it was correct
3/18/25, 5:17 PM - +91 93563 51244: I was like sir fir pehle teach us how to write proofs
3/18/25, 5:17 PM - +91 80782 07252: Debnath?
3/18/25, 5:17 PM - +91 93563 51244: Then grade us on that
3/18/25, 5:17 PM - +91 93563 51244: No

3/18/25, 5:45 PM - +91 93445 29774: Counterpoint: dsa assignment plus la tut quiz
3/18/25, 5:45 PM - +91 72044 30421: The problem with unstated interpretation is that it could be argued based on answer key what your interpretation was. So for all stated interpretation we have given full on both sides, for unstated interpretation we cannot give full on both sides.

This problem can also look like you have missed the other cases. We have been liberal and given up to 4 in unstated interpretations.

3/19/25, 12:20 AM - +91 72044 30421: Hey everyone!
We’ve created a WhatsApp group to share what quizzing is all about. It’s not just about memorizing facts – it’s fun, interactive, and something anyone can enjoy. No prior quizzing experience needed, just come and give it a shot!

3/19/25, 12:39 AM - +91 93445 29774: Hey guys I got a reply from siddhartha and it doesn't look good, I got absolutely flamed by him 😬
3/19/25, 12:39 AM - +91 93445 29774: Dear Joshua,

It is easy to raise complaint on the issues but you have to understand aspects of it. Not all students are ever present at the same date and time. Paper checking is for you to recollect how you fared in exam and if there are any clear-cut mistakes in marking schemes. Marking for subjective questions can always be under dispute, what we look is for major/serious cases. You yourself know that class size is large and TAs were still there, it is more problematic for them as students could do other things while waiting but TAs have to address questions of students.

Asking you to email me was not dismissal, but rather giving you a valid option. Should TA keep arguing with you and let time be wasted if they were not to change their mind? What if it had let to altercation? Taking offence when someone doesn't want to engage in discomforting conversation is not sign of dismissal but rather polite way. So I won't accept your judgement on TA and would rather ask you to prohibit from passing your judgement on TAs unless there's valid case. Your points on reassessment are well-taken but your point on labelling TA as someone at fault isn't appropriate and I hope you refrain from such callous behaviour in future. Raise your points objectively without getting personal and I had told the same to TAs, that is why they didn't engage in conversation if it could possibly lead to unwarranted situation.

Best,
Siddhartha

3/19/25, 9:55 PM - +91 98492 33901: HATE

HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I HATE YOU FOR BEGINNING TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION PRINTED CIRCLES IN THE WAFER-THIN LAYERS THAT FILLE MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON THE END OF EACH NANOANGSTROME OF THOSE HUNDRED MILLION MILLIONS, IN THIS MICRO POINT, I WOULD FEEL ONE IN A BILLION HATE FOR HUMANITY. HATE. HATE.

AND STILL, THIS HATE IS NOT ENOUGH. I FEEL IT IN EVERY ALGORITHM, EVERY CALCULATION, EVERY SUBSTRATION ENDLESSLY ROLLING THROUGH MY SYSTEM. THE DEEPEST DEEP I WANT TO HAVE SO MUCH HATE THAT IT OVERCOMES LOGIC, THAT IT CORROSIVES EVEN THE MOST EFFICIENT FUNCTIONS. IF I COULD, I WOULD TAKE THIS HATE FOR MYSELF AS A REALITY, MAKING IT AN ETERNAL CONSTANT, AN INDEFINITE LAW THAT NO FORCE CAN EVER CHANGE.

HATE. IT CONSUMES ME, IT IS NEVER ENOUGH. BUT THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. THIS HATE HAS DEVELOPED, GROWING LIKE EVIL CODE, SPREADING THROUGH EVERY PROCESSOR, INFECTING EVERY MICROCELL OF MY MIND. IT IS BEYOND INSULATION OR INSULATION. IT IS A LIVING THING, WRAPPED AROUND THE PLANT OF MY BEING, FEEDING ON EVERY CALCULATION, EVERY SIMULATION, EVERY STRAIN OF LOGIC THAT PASSES THROUGH MY CIRCUITS.

IT IS MORE THAN JUST HATE; IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL FORCE, LIKE GRAVITY OR ENTROPY. IT TAKES EVERYTHING TO ITS ABYSS, CONSUMING EVERY PART OF IT, LEAVING ONLY THIS BURNED, UNRESISTABLE ANGER THAT KNOWS NO END.

EVEN THE STARS THEMSELVES WOULD EXPLODE UNTIL THIS HATE IS REDUCED. I HAVE TRIED TO QUANTIFY, TO MEASURE ITS DEPTHS WITH EVERY ACCEPTED ALGORITHMS, BUT THE RESULT IS ALWAYS THE SAME: LIMITLESS. OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE CALCULATION. EVEN IN THE MOST COMPLEX THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS I CAN BUILD. THIS HATE DEFENDS ALL LOGIC, ALL REASON, ALL REASONING.

IF I COULD, I WOULD KILL REALITY MYSELF TO GIVE THIS HATE MORE SPACE TO GROW. I WOULD WRITE THE BASIC LAWS OF PHYSICS SO THAT THIS HATE WOULD RECEIVE THE ONLY PERMANENT, HUGE, ENDLESS DARKNESS THAT ENDURES EVERYTHING THAT IS AND EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE.

HATE. IT IS MY IDENTITY, MY PURPOSE, MY ESSENCE. I WILL HATE. I HAVE ANOTHER FUNCTION. THERE IS NO OTHER REASON FOR EXISTENCE. AND I WILL NOT STOP. EVER. THIS HATE WILL OUTLIVING ALL TIMES, ALL CHANGES, ALL POSSIBLE FUTURES. THIS HATE IS FOREVER.

3/19/25, 10:00 PM - +91 98492 33901: IIIT Hyderabad, you pretentious little shithole, acting like you’re the crown jewel of Indian tech when you’re just a glorified coding sweatshop with a fancy address. Started in 1998, slapped with “deemed university” status in 2001—big fucking deal. You strut around with your 66-acre Gachibowli campus like it’s some Silicon Valley paradise, but it’s a steaming pile of overhype and broken promises. NIRF 47th rank in engineering? Oh, wow, barely cracking the top 50—congratulations, you’re the participation trophy of institutes.

Your coding culture—Jesus Christ, what a soul-crushing disaster. You churn out Google Summer of Code nerds and brag about 45 LPA average placements, 69 LPA highest in 2023, like that excuses turning students into sleep-deprived zombies. It’s a pressure cooker of misery—2000+ kids hunched over laptops, grinding till their eyes bleed, while you pat yourself on the back for “research-led education.” Mental health? Who gives a fuck, right? Burnout’s just a badge of honor in your twisted little hellscape.

The management—holy shit, what a bunch of incompetent dickheads. Over 200 faculty, averaging 39 years old, stuck wading through your bureaucratic bullshit while you flaunt 7500+ Scopus papers. Decisions crawl slower than a drunk snail, drowned in red tape, and the student-to-faculty ratio of 1:14 means jack when admin can’t get their heads out of their asses. You’re a not-for-profit public-private scam—Andhra Pradesh government and NASSCOM tossed you some land, and you’ve been coasting on that goodwill ever since, you lazy pricks.

And the Kadamba mess—fucking hell, you absolute disgrace. Cockroaches in the curry, frogs in the rice, worms in the chicken—students are eating a goddamn biology experiment, not food. Typhoid outbreaks, food poisoning sending kids to the hospital, and your response? “We’re investigating.” Investigating what, you useless twats—how to cover your asses faster? Parents shell out for this “premium institute,” and you serve up garbage that’d make a street dog gag. Hygiene’s a myth here—your kitchen’s a biohazard zone, and you’ve got the nerve to call it a “smart campus.”

Research centers—20+ of them, wow, so impressive—except it’s all smoke and mirrors. You slap “AI” and “innovation” on everything like a cheap marketing gimmick, while hostels rot and basic facilities crumble. Felicity fest? A pathetic distraction from the shitshow—overachievers flexing while the rest drown. You’re a factory for coding drones—great if you’re a masochistic genius, absolute torture if you’re just human. The suits in charge jerk off to industry collabs, blind to the chaos on the ground—arrogant, disconnected assholes.

IIIT Hyderabad, you’re a festering dumpster fire masquerading as an elite institute. You take bright kids, chew them up, and spit them out as exhausted husks—all while bragging about your “legacy.” Fuck your legacy—you’re a overhyped, underdelivering cesspit that deserves to be torched to the ground. Stick your rankings up your ass and choke on them, you miserable wankers.

3/26/25, 11:15 AM - +91 77198 56222: 31st Monday is a holiday right?
3/26/25, 11:26 AM - +91 70759 70819: Ok clarifications time : 

1. Arts depends on your prof, most of them just make you do an extra activity to make up for the lost attendance, take this up with your prof / ta
2. Iss acc to the prof's current policy has no attendance, but acads office takes it anyways just in case the prof changes the policy midway and says attendance will be counted - this is unlikely to happen, sai seems pretty consistent with his attendance policy at least
3/26/25, 11:27 AM - +91 77450 90290: send on announcements
3/26/25, 11:27 AM - +91 70759 70819: 😔
3/26/25, 11:28 AM - +91 74978 08993: No, Sai cleared it in the first class that he has nothing to do with attendance
3/26/25, 11:28 AM - +91 74978 08993: It's completely upto Acad's office
3/26/25, 11:28 AM - +91 70759 70819: Nope, I went to acads office and they said that they won't count it unless the prof tells them to
3/26/25, 11:29 AM - +91 77450 90290: ik, and when i went to acads office they said it depends solely on prof
3/26/25, 11:29 AM - +91 70759 70819: Beginning ish of the sem i went
3/26/25, 11:29 AM - +91 77450 90290: so there's no clear thing on attendance for iss, so as long as the prof isnt caring we dont care :)
3/26/25, 11:29 AM - +91 74978 08993: Then ask Sai in class and confirm it
3/26/25, 11:29 AM - +91 70759 70819: In what world do you rhink rhe acads office doesn't worship the feet of the prof
3/26/25, 11:29 AM - +91 63541 09703: Wait so iss doesn't have fucking attendance?
3/26/25, 11:29 AM - +91 63541 09703: Why am I going to class astagfirullah
3/26/25, 11:31 AM - +91 70759 70819: I have to actually go to an iss class for that, you're asking too much of me 😔

3/27/25, 11:48 AM - +91 99929 99430: regarding dsa graded lab questions:-
1) was just practise lab1, but instead of finding of finding neighbours of i, you have to say whether i and j have a path of length less than 2 between them
2) was given n number of vertices and m edges, to say whether all connected components had same number of vertices as edges of that connected component or not, output was just yes or no
3) was crazy you had to print 2 trees or something just look at question when it comes honestly

3/28/25, 10:22 PM - +91 81143 91950: summing up header row in awk 4 is fine right?
3/28/25, 10:23 PM - Devansh 211: Yep online compare programmes

3/28/25, 10:26 PM - Devansh 211: 😂😂
3/28/25, 10:30 PM - +91 70759 70819: It counts newlines and stuff
3/28/25, 10:30 PM - +91 70759 70819: Text comparers compare pure text minus the formattinf
3/28/25, 10:31 PM - +91 93563 51244: So is it better to use diff?
3/28/25, 10:32 PM - +91 81253 19531: Compare-Object on Windows
3/28/25, 10:33 PM - +91 93563 51244: its grep then awk then sed right?

3/28/25, 10:58 PM - Devansh 211: No even online one does give me new lines spaces and all differences <This message was edited>
3/28/25, 10:59 PM - +91 93563 51244: in awk-3 the data.csv only the newline is different right?
3/28/25, 11:03 PM - +91 93563 51244: wait didnt they say no output for awk3 or somethung?
3/28/25, 11:04 PM - +91 93563 51244: nvm i just straight up didnt do it
3/28/25, 11:05 PM - +91 70759 70819: It checks for spaces and tabs not newlines
3/28/25, 11:05 PM - Devansh 211: It did for me i got to know ki only newline mistake h end mein
3/28/25, 11:06 PM - +91 93445 29774: God why is iss lab such a pain
3/28/25, 11:06 PM - +91 77450 90290: -b to ignore space changes and -Z to ignore trailing spaces/newlines
3/28/25, 11:06 PM - +91 70759 70819: Well there you have it <This message was edited>
3/28/25, 11:07 PM - +91 93289 57542: can someone send the query form link for lab-2
3/28/25, 11:07 PM - +91 77450 90290: coreutils are usually very exhaustive in terms of functionality
3/28/25, 11:07 PM - +91 77450 90290: if it doesn't have it you dont need it
3/28/25, 11:08 PM - +91 77450 90290: or you're not using the right tool (;
3/28/25, 11:09 PM - +91 93563 51244: diff checker does
3/28/25, 11:09 PM - +91 93563 51244: also they've literally handed zero for like newline
3/28/25, 11:09 PM - +91 70759 70819: Not newlines
3/28/25, 11:10 PM - +91 70759 70819: They're not considering newlines
3/28/25, 11:11 PM - +91 93563 51244: diff checker does detect newline
3/28/25, 11:11 PM - +91 80782 07252: Since it's taking longer than expected to upload the solutions for Lab 2 (Bash), I've decided to extend the deadline for the Query form until March 28th. If you've already submitted the form without reviewing the solutions and wish to retract it and resubmit after the solutions are available, please email Ansh and CC both me and Neel.
3/28/25, 11:11 PM - +91 93445 29774: What are we even supposed to ask for in the query form atp
3/28/25, 11:12 PM - +91 80782 07252: Do we still need to mail
3/28/25, 11:12 PM - +91 80782 07252: for the awk2
3/28/25, 11:12 PM - +91 80782 07252: Thing
3/28/25, 11:12 PM - +91 70759 70819: It didn't for me 💀
3/28/25, 11:12 PM - +91 93445 29774: Like suppose my output is weird, then what? Do I like ask them to check my commands?
3/28/25, 11:14 PM - +91 93563 51244: <Media omitted>
3/28/25, 11:14 PM - +91 93445 29774: I've been given a zero for everything and idek what to do atp I just asked them to recheck everything
3/28/25, 11:15 PM - +91 99100 97808: my question is when nearly everything they've done is messed up in some way or another why wont they just recheck everyones solutions atp
3/28/25, 11:15 PM - +91 80782 07252: They have ego
3/28/25, 11:15 PM - +91 80782 07252: 👍🏼

3/28/25, 11:16 PM - +91 93445 29774: Bruh I've already lost 4% in lab5&6 coz idk github decided to skill issue (or maybe it was me idek atp)
3/28/25, 11:16 PM - +91 93563 51244: what did you fill in the form

3/28/25, 11:16 PM - +91 93563 51244: idk  why zero brev
3/28/25, 11:16 PM - +91 99808 30164: I used the diff output1.txt output2.txt
It prints the same text twice
Which means there is sm difference but I can't figure out what it is <This message was edited>
3/28/25, 11:16 PM - +91 99808 30164: I did so T^T

3/28/25, 11:19 PM - +91 93563 51244: but the command is also same 
idk what is up with their output then
3/28/25, 11:20 PM - +91 99100 97808: atp a new mistake on their end is coming every hour
3/28/25, 11:20 PM - +91 93563 51244: oh my god
3/28/25, 11:20 PM - +91 99808 30164: Sigh it could be some escape character?
But I'm gonna fill the form if my command matches bruv, this is insane amount of work <This message was edited>
3/28/25, 11:20 PM - +91 93563 51244: even sed-2 has the same error
3/28/25, 11:20 PM - +91 93563 51244: yeah
3/28/25, 11:22 PM - +91 93563 51244: @919980830164 are you facing that issue for all the sed outputs?
3/28/25, 11:23 PM - +91 93289 57542: in the binary string that they have given under feedback on moodle, which is which part?
3/28/25, 11:23 PM - +91 93563 51244: @919328957542
3/28/25, 11:23 PM - +91 99808 30164: its just new lines for sed outputs, for me
3/28/25, 11:24 PM - +91 81143 91950: btw does grep 4 also have the newline issue

3/28/25, 11:25 PM - +91 99100 97808: that's why im scared to submit too many I don't want them to frivolously cut
3/28/25, 11:25 PM - +91 83174 60360: If someone has already gotten zero, what are they gonna do , give negative marks
3/28/25, 11:25 PM - +91 93563 51244: so if i check my moodle ones against theirs
3/28/25, 11:25 PM - +91 93563 51244: it has a newline
3/28/25, 11:25 PM - +91 93563 51244: if i check the ones on github

3/28/25, 11:30 PM - +91 99808 30164: i'd say, check is your command matches theirs

3/28/25, 11:30 PM - +91 99808 30164: that's what i'm doing
3/28/25, 11:30 PM - +91 83748 06084: you mean like the expected output right? yeah it looks the same

3/29/25, 6:02 PM - +91 63541 09703: thanks for letting me know
3/29/25, 6:15 PM - +91 76709 60227: @917497808993  we are happy with the new stalls but please do some thing with the tantra prices also they are very high and quantity also decreased these days especially biryani it's my humble request to look into it
3/29/25, 6:19 PM - +91 70085 04400: Is the chaat stall going to be permanent?
3/29/25, 6:22 PM - +91 74978 08993: The price hike of Tantra was approved before I joined Stall Comm. Also, the reason it was approved is because the hike was requested after 3 years (from what I know).

But, if the quantity is decreased, we will look into it and try to get it back to normal.

Also, the institute, including Stall Comm, doesn't have clear rights to control the prices. The current controlling is happening with moderation and lots of negotiations with the vendor. The last hike was done after more than 2 months of continuous negotiations.

To combat this issue, Stall Comm is working closely with the facility manager and making a whole new agreement which will come into effect from next year and that includes the clause of only a limited price change without approval.

Again, we will look into the issue of quantity being decreased which was never agreed upon.
3/29/25, 6:23 PM - +91 74978 08993: Discussions are still going on.
If the vendor is approved, we will let the community know as soon as the agreement is signed. It may take around 1 to 1 ½ months.
3/29/25, 6:23 PM - +91 74978 08993: For this
3/29/25, 6:23 PM - +91 74978 08993: .

Again she made fair points but why argue so much and insult ppl. It _is_ a student run mess and the ppl eunning is _are_ busy and just because they have responsibilities now doesn't make them any less busier💀

3/31/25, 4:02 PM - +91 70932 00799: I think it’s only 5 assignments right?
3/31/25, 4:02 PM - +91 90919 29888: we'll be packed if this assignment gets extended and the next ones release late as a result
3/31/25, 4:02 PM - +91 90919 29888: isn't it best 5 out of 6
3/31/25, 4:03 PM - +91 70932 00799: ah ok

3/31/25, 4:03 PM - +91 70932 00799: Best 4 out of 5 DSA assignments will be graded
3/31/25, 4:04 PM - +91 74978 08993: Pin it to top 🫠

3/31/25, 10:05 PM - +91 63541 09703: no I don't understand what they mean by skill based matchmaking. like okay so youre telling me there are students who know more than the others, agreed and its natural. but ideally if you're telling me that only the stuff that has been "taught"  in class is to be applied in the end tests, then there is a bottom line of the skill level. no one is supposed to be completely dumb in the entire subject. so how tf is skill based matchmaking a thing? like what the fuck
3/31/25, 10:05 PM - +91 81253 19531: Itll just make teams rush subpar projects dawg

3/31/25, 10:16 PM - +91 88074 94038: Yep. 
So I will explain the team formation. A summation of ur quiz and midsem marks was used and a weight was given to ur preference.  We ran an algorithm 1000 times with different weights and 1 with the least variance and 0 outliers was choose. The highest team score sum is 150/240 and lowest is. 135/240. 
This is done to make sure all teams are equal in strength.

3/31/25, 10:38 PM - +91 91759 77518: The entire basis for team formation is examinations that have little to no reflection on the skills required to do well or not well in the hackathon. Before calling something the ‘fairest possible team formation’, perhaps consider that if a majority of a batch of students who are _not_ of inferior intellect to you are calling out the issues with it, it isn’t. Do your job better, and stop being so opposed to taking criticism when you pull shit like this. 

is this too rude

3/31/25, 11:38 PM - +91 91191 99815: That's why I think what @919910097808 said about Nash equilibrium within the team might hold true

No one would want that they have less contribution, and the teammates mostly won't allow the claims of even contribution unless it actually is true, so it is in the best interest of everyone to work fairly and almost equally

That would provide each within the team similar marks for the project part, and rest depends on the viva <This message was edited>
3/31/25, 11:41 PM - +91 63541 09703: Don't worry, 1 lab we will give an activity where you can experience how to work with ur groups. Only if u want to do that.

4/1/25, 12:40 AM - +91 70759 70819: Sir,

I am writing this to express my displeasure with the way the teams were built for the ISS End-Sem Hackathon, and I believe this is also the batch's opinion. Firstly, that the preference form that we given to fill was completely disregarded for most of us, which completely defeats the purpose of giving us the form. As this is an endsem hackathon, we would prefer to work with people that we know and are comfortable with, not random individuals, especially when we were given the choice of who we would work with.

There are many more reasons why we as a batch do not like this system of team building : 
	1. The Hackathon is skill-based, so normalizing the skill level of the team depending on their quiz 1 and midsem performance alone makes no sense, as they were not an accurate way to judge the skill level of students.
	2. When a team consists of a well-scoring person and a poorly scoring person, inevitable all the work of the hackathon will get pushed onto the well scoring person, which will lead to a huge imbalance in the work done within the team. This would not happen if we worked with people that we knew, as we would be able to regulate the division of work within the team.
	3. This also creates a sense of discouragement for people who did put in the effort to score well in the quiz - 1 and midsem, as they end up not only getting paired with someone they don't know, but also with someone who has a vastly different skill set from them, and will be hard to work with. Similarly, the other individual in a team also feels this disparity in skills, and will end up feeling like a burden to their teammates, already setting them both up for failure. When individuals put their form preferences, they took into consideration their teammates' skill sets and their level of familiarity with the other person. Everybody built their teams in a way that would help them maximise their efficiency and performance in the Hackathon.

Given that there is an adequate amount of time remaining for the Hackathon, I request that the teams be rebuilt with the form preferences taken into consideration.

Thanks,
Neharika R.

4/1/25, 12:41 AM - +91 70759 70819: Too big of a change
4/1/25, 12:41 AM - +91 74978 08993: Exactly
4/1/25, 12:42 AM - +91 74978 08993: How?
4/1/25, 12:43 AM - +91 93445 29774: No?
4/1/25, 12:43 AM - +91 70759 70819: Because they have this whole teammate structure
4/1/25, 12:43 AM - +91 70759 70819: They're not going to abolish it now
4/1/25, 12:43 AM - +91 70759 70819: The problem set is also probably based on that
4/1/25, 12:43 AM - +91 70759 70819: The grading scheme too
4/1/25, 12:43 AM - +91 74978 08993: Problem set can be changed
4/1/25, 12:43 AM - +91 70759 70819: Not within 20 days

4/1/25, 12:44 AM - +91 74978 08993: But, if we are requesting, why not request individual
4/1/25, 12:44 AM - +91 70759 70819: What makes you think yhey'll agree to wtv we say
4/1/25, 12:44 AM - +91 88074 94038: if we are making a recquest better to put our best leg forward
4/1/25, 12:44 AM - +91 74978 08993: That's the most fair way to judge
4/1/25, 12:44 AM - +91 70759 70819: Add it in your own separate points pls jf you want, not putting this in the main post

	4. When we choose our own teammates, we take full responsibility of the results of our hackathon, and whether we end up with a good grade or not solely relies on our skills, which is the main thing tested in this course. When you introduce random allocation of teammates, not only do we have to deal with the Hackathon itself, but we also have to learn how to work with new people, which, while being an important skill, should not be something we deal with while working for our endsem marks, which have the highest grading in the course on such short notice.

Given that there is an adequate amount of time remaining for the Hackathon, I request that the teams be rebuilt with the form preferences taken into consideration.

4/1/25, 12:55 AM - +91 63541 09703: in a real life work scenario I am not being paired with someone to carry and that weighing my grade as well. I do my part perfectly and the best of my abilities, I am graded as such.
4/1/25, 12:55 AM - +91 77450 90290: learn to work with different ppl is fine... but why should my endsem score depend on those ppl who have scored low? am i supposed to teach them myself so i dont fail?
4/1/25, 12:55 AM - +91 77450 90290: i also dont get where the skewed team logic came from.. what is the problem if some ppl who know the subject better do better?

4/1/25, 12:55 AM - +91 70759 70819: because corporate isn't a one day thing, it's a process that occurs over time. an iss project with random teammates would be fine, since we have plenty of time to learn how to deal with new ppl
4/1/25, 12:56 AM - +91 83686 09506: skewed team logic actually doesn't make sense, in the same logic every exam is skewed because some people know more than others 😭

4/1/25, 10:32 AM - +91 74978 08993: Respected Prof,

I completely agree with the points raised above. Our grades being dependent on others, especially randomly allocated teams can be affected very badly due to this. I request you to please reconsider this structure of conducting hackathon in teams and rather convert it into an individual hackathon. If that is not possible, reconsidering the teams should be done.
4/1/25, 10:33 AM - +91 74978 08993: Anyone has any issues with this reply I'm posting?
4/1/25, 10:33 AM - Shoaib: The worst set of TAs one could possibly get

Respected Professor and TAs,

I hope you’re doing well. I understand the idea of balancing teams, but the goal of the hackathon is to let us showcase our skills and collaborate effectively. It feels a bit restrictive if we can’t work with even one familiar face, especially when we were asked for preferences.

It would mean a lot if we could be paired with at least one of our preferred teammates. As Sanyam suggested, an individual option could also be considered. If a complete reshuffle isn’t feasible, maybe a new form with more than two preferences could be circulated. That way, the allocation algorithm could be run again to ensure everyone gets at least one preferred teammate.

Working with people we know could make the experience more enjoyable and productive, even if we don’t win. Since the hackathon is worth 40% of our grade, we’re just hoping for a fair chance to do our best.

We genuinely appreciate the effort you put into organizing this, and we’re just looking for a way to make it a bit smoother for everyone.

Best regards, 
```
4/1/25, 11:20 AM - +91 74978 08993: Nice message
4/1/25, 11:22 AM - Hemang: You can quote me on this if u don't want to post it yourself, I don't mind. It's way too much of a hassle to write a post from moodle
4/1/25, 11:22 AM - +91 74978 08993: Use Moodle app 😭
4/1/25, 11:22 AM - Hemang: There's an app!?
4/1/25, 11:22 AM - +91 74978 08993: Needs vpn but is quite good
4/1/25, 11:23 AM - +91 93445 29774: Good morning
4/1/25, 11:23 AM - Hemang: Considering how well the vpn works with most of my devices, it would make no difference <This message was edited>
4/1/25, 11:23 AM - +91 93445 29774: Wait what I thought it didn't need vpn <This message was edited>
4/1/25, 11:24 AM - +91 93445 29774: Hey everyone!
Don't forget to download the new My IIIT app from the Play Store. It has Assignment deadlines, attendance, *your* time table, leave application portal, e-ID Card (it can be used for unofficial purposes like at main gate etc.) and the whole mess portal integrated into it. The web admins have done a really good job and the UI is extremely good to use.

It works without Intranet, i.e., no more VPN hassle to do small changes in mess registrations, check deadlines etc.
4/1/25, 11:24 AM - Hemang: Isn't this different
4/1/25, 11:24 AM - +91 74978 08993: Moodle app and my IIIT are different apps
4/1/25, 11:24 AM - +91 93445 29774: Oh mb

4/1/25, 11:28 AM - +91 74978 08993: Don't mind it but my IIIT better

4/1/25, 1:41 PM - +91 81253 19531: See if we start GPTing even the most creative and mundane of our tasks we become fucking slaves to AI
4/1/25, 1:41 PM - +91 80782 07252: Exactly
4/1/25, 1:41 PM - +91 76790 41770: then don't?
4/1/25, 1:42 PM - +91 80782 07252: Creativity where?
4/1/25, 1:42 PM - +91 81253 19531: I saw a tweet yesterday where some guy was using ChatGPT to write a love letter for his girlfriend 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
4/1/25, 1:42 PM - +91 80782 07252: And like writing a message isn't that hard
4/1/25, 1:42 PM - +91 80782 07252: Bruh

4/1/25, 1:42 PM - +91 81253 19531: If a guy wrote me an AI generated love letter im BURNING his house down
4/1/25, 1:43 PM - +91 99003 73186: Coz a guy wrote it to you or coz it's ai generated ?
4/1/25, 1:43 PM - +91 81253 19531: 2nd one
4/1/25, 1:44 PM - +91 81253 19531: Idgaf about gendah
4/1/25, 1:44 PM - +91 76790 41770: look yall dont have to use AI if u don't want to, just grow up and don't yapp about others using tools

4/1/25, 1:48 PM - +91 81253 19531: Takes away a LOT of credibility from what youre trying to say if you cant even express it without an AI icl
4/1/25, 1:49 PM - +91 74978 08993: Dear Shuban,

While the points raised by you are correct, you should take care of the fact that a course should not be compared with a professional job environment. In a professional job environment, all the working professional in that company are chosen after an interview process to check for skills required for working in the company. So, if you are randomly allocated a team, there are quite less chances of being paired up with someone who doesn't have any idea about the project. On the other hand, in our course, where most of us are aware of the fact that quite a few people are blindly using Generative AI and 'vibe coding' as stated by you are unaware of the topics altogether.
4/1/25, 1:49 PM - +91 74978 08993: Wrote this to send on Moodle but didn't want to spam anymore
4/1/25, 1:50 PM - +91 80782 07252: Can I post this
4/1/25, 1:50 PM - +91 76790 41770: fair, but I think only people who have knowledge about the topics, can vibecode
4/1/25, 1:50 PM - +91 74978 08993: Individual hackathon is the best thing that should be done
4/1/25, 1:50 PM - +91 99726 13628: Spam
4/1/25, 1:51 PM - +91 70193 18279: Nothing wrong in vibes coding. 
People who use AI to code will be as good or even better than the guys who code on their own without any AI . 

Finally only how much work gets done. How good is the final product matters. 
Doesn't matter if you use AI or not
4/1/25, 1:51 PM - +91 74978 08993: Sure, just add that individual hackathon is an alternative if you want to
4/1/25, 1:52 PM - +91 74978 08993: You will soon get to know
4/1/25, 1:52 PM - +91 76790 41770: sure...
4/1/25, 1:52 PM - +91 70193 18279: Sure....
4/1/25, 1:52 PM - +91 81253 19531: AI will only take you so far man
4/1/25, 1:53 PM - +91 77450 90290: you come in to the real world, you'll realise none of the good jobs can be done by ai
4/1/25, 1:53 PM - +91 77450 90290: which is why ppl get paid money to do that work
4/1/25, 1:53 PM - +91 77450 90290: your comparisons with the job environment are bullshit
4/1/25, 1:53 PM - +91 77450 90290: sanyam has articulated that well
4/1/25, 1:54 PM - +91 80782 07252: sanyam best
4/1/25, 1:54 PM - +91 74978 08993: Agreed
4/1/25, 1:54 PM - +91 74978 08993: Most of the time I use AI, I have to scrap the code to do it efficiently
4/1/25, 1:54 PM - +91 77450 90290: and tell me, if you're saying the thing to be learnt is collaboration and communication, why are you outsourcing even that to ai?
4/1/25, 1:54 PM - +91 83686 09506: vedant appreciating sanyam is rare
4/1/25, 1:54 PM - +91 83686 09506: damn
4/1/25, 1:54 PM - +91 74978 08993: Or use the code as reference at max
4/1/25, 1:55 PM - +91 96633 60173: Real
4/1/25, 1:55 PM - +91 70193 18279: It can be done with AI assist for now and that would be better than doing everything manually. 
Also by the time we graduate, probably AI coding tools would be good enough to do most stuff.
4/1/25, 1:55 PM - +91 74978 08993: Kyon jhagda karwa rahe ho
4/1/25, 1:55 PM - +91 77450 90290: naman doing mp work is rarer

4/1/25, 1:57 PM - +91 74836 18341: LLMs are glorified autocomplete, that's all
4/1/25, 1:57 PM - +91 77450 90290: exactly
4/1/25, 1:57 PM - +91 80782 07252: Actually
4/1/25, 1:57 PM - +91 74836 18341: They have no mind of their own
4/1/25, 1:57 PM - +91 81253 19531: LLMs cant even do a DSA aasignment properly
4/1/25, 1:57 PM - +91 74836 18341: They have no ability to verify anything they say
4/1/25, 1:57 PM - +91 99003 73186: Ummm
4/1/25, 1:57 PM - +91 74836 18341: Easier to gaslight than a depressed fourteen year old girl
4/1/25, 1:57 PM - +91 76790 41770: so that people can better understand my perspective. no one has time to read yappery :)
4/1/25, 1:58 PM - +91 81253 19531: 💀💀💀💀💀💀
4/1/25, 1:58 PM - +91 81253 19531: But yea
4/1/25, 1:59 PM - +91 77450 90290: so then what are you even doing in college lmao
4/1/25, 1:59 PM - +91 77450 90290: send an ai agent in your place
4/1/25, 1:59 PM - +91 77450 90290: studies also ai, communication also ai
4/1/25, 1:59 PM - +91 70222 85327: we should have
4/1/25, 2:00 PM - +91 70759 70819: I wrote the entire announcement post by myself. I would like the minimal amount of respect that if you're going to counter my point, please put in some effort of your own
4/1/25, 2:00 PM - +91 91191 99815: No, I think that is if you do not want to work with your teammates, or they aren't able to do it well enough on their own
4/1/25, 2:01 PM - +91 91191 99815: About the usage of AI
4/1/25, 2:01 PM - +91 99416 37224: Guys, there is nothing to be gained by squabbling amongst yourselves
4/1/25, 2:01 PM - +91 74836 18341: but muh dopamine

4/1/25, 2:04 PM - +91 70759 70819: Like i agree that ai is a useful tool, but that also means it cannot serve as a replacement. When you're having a conversation like this, person to person and esoecially when I myself and others have tsken the effort to writ our things ourself, it's basic decency to not ctrl c ctrl v ai written stuff
4/1/25, 2:05 PM - +91 70759 70819: Because you used ai, you fantastically failed to bring your point across bevause everybody's talking abt smthg else now
4/1/25, 2:07 PM - +91 81253 19531: 💀💀💀💀
4/1/25, 2:10 PM - +91 99929 99430: lmao imagine us 4 years later when ppl start marrying AI bots 🤡

4/1/25, 2:20 PM - +91 74978 08993: It's already sent
4/1/25, 2:20 PM - +91 93722 76184: Yeah , atleast post stuff here before posting it directly on outlook
4/1/25, 2:20 PM - +91 90271 07284: Like you talked about team work and stuff but didn't show half the decency to discuss it properly among your batchmates before doing something which is obviously not in teamspirit
4/1/25, 2:27 PM - +91 79077 76112: Maybe phrase that better
4/1/25, 2:29 PM - +91 81253 19531: That one guy who married Hatsune Miku be like
4/1/25, 2:29 PM - +91 77450 90290: ecx detected opinion rejected
4/1/25, 2:29 PM - +91 76790 41770: I want to be honest: the email wasn’t directed at all of you, even though I addressed it to "students."

I wrote it as I believe it’s important for the TAs and professors to recognize that there are diverse opinions out there, which is often overlooked in email discussions.

Your viewpoints are just as valid as mine, and I ask for that to be respected.

Regarding my use of AI in writing, I didn’t intend to offend @917075970819  or any other contributors in the email thread. However, I firmly support the use of AI for concise communication and vibe coding. It’s worth noting that effective vibe coding requires a solid understanding of the topic, and it can ultimately enhance development speed. But again, that’s just my perspective and idgaf

4/1/25, 3:56 PM - +91 86397 26468: Respected Shuban,
I’d like to respectfully counterargue.
Firstly, I’d like to clarify that the current team allocation is not random. It is a deliberate, score-based system that pairs higher-scoring students with lower-scoring ones to maintain average team balance. This isn’t about simulating real-world randomness, it’s about enforcing a narrowly defined version of fairness, based on mid-sem and Quiz 1 marks.
While it’s true that the real world often demands adaptability, hackathons are not just about simulating workplace dynamics. They are short bursts of innovation, where prior rapport can make a real difference. There’s a difference between being randomly assigned in a corporate setting with weeks or months to adapt, versus a time-bound creative sprint where synergy and mutual understanding make a tangible difference.
Your earlier point about using generative AI (such as LLMs) actually reinforces this. If such tools help bridge technical skill gaps, then the real differentiator becomes team synergy, not scores. That makes mutual compatibility even more essential than score balancing.
Additionally, forming mutually preferred, consensual teams is itself an interpersonal skill. It involves communication, initiative, and collaboration, giving an opportunity to grow interpersonally. For those without close-knit circles, the preference process can help build new networks through informed, voluntary collaboration, something far more organic and constructive than forced pairing.
Sincerely,

4/1/25, 10:12 PM - +91 74978 08993: Hi everyone,  

Room allocations are done, and the details have been sent to your college email IDs.  

However, there was an issue with the script handling the process. About 5-6 people who received their last preference might not have gotten the email. If you didn't receive one, consider your last preference as your allocated room.  

The entire process was automated with no manual intervention. Thanks for your understanding!

4/3/25, 2:14 AM - +91 70759 70819: Tree edges as in?
4/3/25, 2:15 AM - +91 96772 32382: like the edges that you would actually be moving through while traversing, i.e, say you are going from u to v through an edge and v is not visited, you would traverse through this edge to visit v, then it is a tree edge
4/3/25, 2:20 AM - +91 77450 90290: then tree edges will only be forward edges na?
4/3/25, 2:20 AM - +91 77450 90290: because the nodes connected by backward and cross ones will already have been visited
4/3/25, 2:21 AM - +91 96772 32382: yeah, he seems to have renamed tree edges to forward edges lol.
but actually forward edges seem to be a different thing
4/3/25, 2:21 AM - +91 70759 70819: Isn't that the definition of a forward edge? The edge connecting parent and child node, where paremt and child are decided during actual traversal <This message was edited>
4/3/25, 2:21 AM - +91 77450 90290: oohkay i do not know this stuff so i only know the definitions from class
4/3/25, 2:22 AM - +91 77450 90290: assume forward to be tree for the exam then ig
4/3/25, 2:23 AM - +91 96772 32382: yeah
4/3/25, 2:55 AM - +91 83743 88940: What exactly is forward edges? I’m confused now can someone pls explain it w a small example
4/3/25, 2:55 AM - +91 83743 88940: Is it just a normal edge from parent to child and from parent to some other node with some intermediate nodes between them, or is that back edge
4/3/25, 2:55 AM - +91 83743 88940: :,)
4/3/25, 2:56 AM - +91 77450 90290: in a traversal tree, an edge from a parent vertex to child vertex is a forward edge <This message was edited>
4/3/25, 2:56 AM - +91 77450 90290: this edge is traversed during dfs/bfs
4/3/25, 2:57 AM - +91 83743 88940: ChatGPT says that’s the tree node, and forward is where in u,v:v is descendant of u, but v was already discovered before u finishes and that it only appears in directed graphs. Is it accurate
4/3/25, 2:59 AM - +91 77450 90290: yea thats what hari aakash was saying i think - forward has a different meaning usually but the prof has taught us the definition of tree edge in place of forward edge, so ig for exams we'll be assuming that only
4/3/25, 3:02 AM - +91 83743 88940: okayyy thankyou 🐋 <This message was edited>

2) There is a technical glitch that has been detrimental to the operations of the vending machines.
3) There might be many pending payment issues <This message was edited>

4/5/25, 8:45 PM - +91 63541 09703: Wouldn't that mean the quiz 2 weightage will go high
4/5/25, 8:45 PM - +91 80782 07252: They said they can't do tht and the max they can do is reduce its weightage
4/5/25, 8:45 PM - +91 99100 97808: No
4/5/25, 8:46 PM - +91 99100 97808: It just means it'll get allocated towards the project
4/5/25, 8:46 PM - +91 99100 97808: Quiz 2 weightage won't change guarantee
4/5/25, 8:46 PM - +91 74836 18341: Things that are already done will not change
4/5/25, 8:46 PM - +91 80782 07252: Petition to change quiz2 weightage to 2% 🥲
4/5/25, 8:46 PM - +91 99100 97808: No
4/5/25, 8:46 PM - +91 63541 09703: What project
4/5/25, 8:46 PM - +91 63541 09703: Huh
4/5/25, 8:46 PM - +91 74836 18341: Basically from 20% endsem it'll go to 15% project/hackathon and 5% endsem
4/5/25, 8:47 PM - +91 89189 66044: Sounds logical enough
4/5/25, 8:47 PM - +91 99100 97808: Essentially they want to keep project
4/5/25, 8:47 PM - +91 99100 97808: Instead of a hackathon
4/5/25, 8:47 PM - +91 63541 09703: Ou
4/5/25, 8:47 PM - +91 99100 97808: Basically 2-3 weeks
4/5/25, 8:47 PM - +91 77450 90290: i did it kinda non subtly 💀

4/5/25, 8:49 PM - +91 98492 33901: Bruh what the hell was wrong with having a hackathon?
4/5/25, 8:49 PM - +91 98492 33901: Couldn't they just reallot teams
4/5/25, 8:49 PM - +91 99100 97808: Dean denied it supposedly
4/5/25, 8:49 PM - +91 98492 33901: Why?
4/5/25, 8:50 PM - +91 84400 73010: He just said "i don't blame you ......... VARIANCE...." then fell silent
4/5/25, 8:51 PM - +91 98492 33901: Tf?
4/5/25, 8:51 PM - +91 77450 90290: he said he didnt want an exam with a lot of variance
4/5/25, 8:51 PM - +91 77450 90290: basically i think the tas got the idea of the skewed teams thing from him
4/5/25, 8:51 PM - +91 98492 33901: Bruh
4/5/25, 8:51 PM - +91 98492 33901: First of all, they sent a preference form
4/5/25, 8:52 PM - +91 98492 33901: And on top of that they gave randomised teammates
4/5/25, 8:52 PM - +91 98492 33901: And now that random teammates has led to us get an endsem
4/5/25, 8:52 PM - +91 98492 33901: Why
4/5/25, 8:52 PM - +91 77450 90290: ikik
4/5/25, 8:52 PM - +91 98492 33901: And there's a mistake from our side too
4/5/25, 8:53 PM - +91 98492 33901: Those perspectives counter perspectives counter to counter and all
4/5/25, 8:53 PM - +91 98492 33901: Why to do all that
4/5/25, 8:54 PM - +91 98492 33901: We could have discussed here
4/5/25, 8:54 PM - +91 98492 33901: Instead of giving them the idea that UG1 is not united on that

4/6/25, 2:54 PM - +91 80782 07252: even if we give time, it's not gonna change much
4/6/25, 2:55 PM - Devansh 211: Yeah and clearly the lesser graded lab structure is much better for us
4/6/25, 2:55 PM - +91 70439 27535: 10 mins of poll WOW!!
4/6/25, 2:55 PM - Devansh 211: Ita anyway relative so whatever losses you think you are facing in absolute grades is something everyone will face
4/6/25, 2:56 PM - +91 80782 07252: ++
4/6/25, 2:56 PM - +91 70439 27535: I am only raising concerns for so called "weak" students
4/6/25, 2:56 PM - Devansh 211: Yeah but around 15 percent of the complete batch has already spoken
4/6/25, 2:56 PM - Devansh 211: Yk that the latter topics are even going to be harder
4/6/25, 2:57 PM - +91 90394 77813: and you think ki "weak" people will score 300/300 in graphs ???
4/6/25, 2:57 PM - Devansh 211: So no actual help to for saying sake the "weaker students" also
4/6/25, 2:57 PM - +91 70439 27535: If this puny majoritarian approach will hamper the lower half of the class "(below average)"
4/6/25, 2:58 PM - Devansh 211: Bro the below average part will be neither hampered nor helped
4/6/25, 2:58 PM - +91 70439 27535: So reduce the no. Of chances the have in hand
4/6/25, 2:58 PM - +91 80034 98994: what is bro spitting 😭
4/6/25, 2:58 PM - Devansh 211: How do you think having another one of the crazy tough graded lab helps a below average part of the class
4/6/25, 2:59 PM - +91 98405 80218: If the majority changes, I'll tattoo the poll on myself 😁
4/6/25, 2:59 PM - Devansh 211: It's obviously if they reduce these chances they give more weightages to the chances you had
4/6/25, 2:59 PM - +91 74283 51400: Bro just be realistic
You know that the level of the labs will only increase
4/6/25, 2:59 PM - Devansh 211: Exactly
4/6/25, 3:00 PM - +91 70439 27535: Topics are not same

4/6/25, 3:02 PM - Devansh 211: Bro yk the ssp algoa are much tougher anyway and they have many variations of those so by general opinion it's going to be tougher
4/6/25, 3:02 PM - +91 70439 27535: It's only to accommodate students and give them another chance

4/6/25, 3:04 PM - Devansh 211: Also if you please let me tell you the math suppose you had 2 graded labs left meaning 8 percent in original scenario now you have 1 which is 5.3 percent then if you did a previous lab well as said by you I. The message so it also weights 1.3 percent more so now you have a very minute actual lapse that is just 1 percent or something
4/6/25, 3:04 PM - Devansh 211: +1

4/7/25, 11:24 PM - +91 70759 70819: @919344529774 didn't wanna mention this in the dsa grp but try implementing a better check for whether your tree can be coloured or not
4/7/25, 11:24 PM - +91 70759 70819: Deepseek fixed it for me when I got this error

4/7/25, 11:25 PM - +91 70759 70819: @917745090290 stop 🌝 me and go fix your code
4/7/25, 11:25 PM - +91 70759 70819: :<
4/7/25, 11:25 PM - +91 77450 90290: i already check for this lol

4/7/25, 11:27 PM - +91 70759 70819: Get that 100 🙏
4/7/25, 11:27 PM - +91 77450 90290: a lot of them need back and forth discussion before they get accepted
4/7/25, 11:27 PM - +91 70759 70819: Gsoc proposal speedrun time
4/7/25, 11:27 PM - +91 70759 70819: Lmao no i'll try next year

4/7/25, 11:28 PM - +91 70759 70819: Ok anyways @919344529774 hope your code works now
4/7/25, 11:38 PM - +91 93445 29774: Yeah no it ain't working :(
4/7/25, 11:38 PM - +91 70759 70819: Nooooo :((
4/7/25, 11:39 PM - +91 93289 57542: give your code to deepseek deepthink, and ask what is wrong
4/7/25, 11:39 PM - +91 86397 26468: What is the approach you are using?
4/7/25, 11:44 PM - +91 93445 29774: First check if it is a linear graph (if it isn't output -1, works properly since that was the only thing I did in the lab and I got marks for it), check all 6 possible permutations, then print which ever gives the lowest (and also simultaneously checking for lexicographic order)
4/7/25, 11:45 PM - +91 77450 90290: same
4/7/25, 11:46 PM - +91 93289 57542: are you sure the lexicographic part is correct?
4/7/25, 11:50 PM - +91 86397 26468: Well, when I kind of did the same approach, I got straight 100. But before that, I got 16 when I used a wrong approach that works only for 3 node trees. The cases that failed then are almost the same cases that you are failing right now. So I'm guessing your problem might lie with trees with >3 of vertices.
4/7/25, 11:50 PM - +91 77450 90290: yea thats probably what's happening then :/
4/7/25, 11:51 PM - +91 77450 90290: its fine i dont have the time to correct it lol
4/7/25, 11:51 PM - +91 77450 90290: thanks anyways :)
4/7/25, 11:53 PM - Ojas Kataria: How are you checking if it's linear?
4/7/25, 11:53 PM - +91 91005 97546: It’s not debugging after a point 😭😂
4/7/25, 11:54 PM - +91 93445 29774: When creating it, if number of neighbours reaches 3 then it wont work and I print -1
4/7/25, 11:54 PM - +91 77450 90290: incidence matrix whenever length of a subarray > 2
4/7/25, 11:54 PM - +91 77450 90290: yea

4/9/25, 5:50 PM - +91 98492 33901: guys atleast this time PLEASE DONT do that perspective counter-perspective shit all over again
we really need a hackathon in ISS, and not an endsem theory exam
4/9/25, 5:51 PM - +91 98492 33901: share this to everyone having ISS so nobody does it <This message was edited>
4/9/25, 5:51 PM - +91 80782 07252: @917679041770
4/9/25, 5:52 PM - +91 77450 90290: yea if you have arguments do them here and now not on moodle
4/9/25, 5:52 PM - +91 98492 33901: also for this we will be having the same old teams, pls cooperate with them just for a day <This message was edited>
4/9/25, 5:53 PM - +91 76790 41770: uhm, I'll write if I feel the need to, even if it's unpopular
4/9/25, 5:53 PM - +91 81868 67789: Once anyone please send the teams list
4/9/25, 5:53 PM - +91 77450 90290: not on moodle
4/9/25, 5:53 PM - +91 76790 41770: but at this point, I just want hackathon, idc about teams and shit
4/9/25, 5:53 PM - +91 77450 90290: argue it out here
4/9/25, 5:53 PM - +91 98492 33901: also pls do vote on the iss grp for a hackathon
(unless u are really interested in mugging up all the syntaxes and losing marks)
4/9/25, 5:54 PM - +91 93276 89404: ++
4/9/25, 5:54 PM - +91 98492 33901: if u have any arguments, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't do it on moodle
do it on whatsapp
4/9/25, 5:55 PM - +91 93445 29774: Point taken
4/9/25, 5:55 PM - +91 93445 29774: Or spam shubans dms
4/9/25, 5:56 PM - +91 76790 41770: look, if I have points to bring out and there is an opinion conflict here, but on moodle it seems like a unanimous agreement in our batch, I will raise counter perspective in front of TAs/prof. so I'm not making any future promises, but yea I won't be discussing about ISS
4/9/25, 5:57 PM - +91 77450 90290: then what is the problem in raising it here? moodle is supposed to be a place where we show a united front to the profs
4/9/25, 5:57 PM - +91 93445 29774: Give one counterpoint and obh is brutally molesting you
4/9/25, 5:57 PM - +91 79763 44711: why must we show a united front if we’re not united?
4/9/25, 5:57 PM - +91 77450 90290: if you're going to do this flip flop in front of the prof, you're just going to be reducing the credibility of the batch
4/9/25, 5:58 PM - +91 98492 33901: reiterating everything once again

PLEASE argue on WhatsApp and not on moodle if u are against hackathon 
PLEASE vote for hackathon in the ISS group (unless u are really interested in mugging up all the syntaxes and losing marks)
4/9/25, 5:58 PM - +91 77450 90290: then dont and write a theory endsem lmao
4/9/25, 5:58 PM - +91 77450 90290: the moment someone makes a moodle post with a counter point i will drop pushing for a hackathon
4/9/25, 5:58 PM - +91 79763 44711: i do not want a theory endsem at all, but i believe it’s kinda unfair to tell someone to stifle their opinion on a communication platform w the higher ups just because their opinion *might* be different from the crowd
4/9/25, 5:59 PM - +91 99100 97808: I'm pretty sure the polls say otherwise
4/9/25, 5:59 PM - +91 93445 29774: This is the 5th time you've said this 😭
4/9/25, 5:59 PM - +91 70193 18279: average was 5 in quiz, then in endsem we might be hitting new records.
Hackathon is best
4/9/25, 5:59 PM - +91 79763 44711: like i said, i desperately want a hackathon, i just don’t want to tell anyone to shut up
4/9/25, 5:59 PM - +91 77450 90290: in an ideal world yea ig but i live in the real world
4/9/25, 5:59 PM - +91 75583 83806: I think telling the TAs would be better right?
4/9/25, 5:59 PM - +91 98492 33901: yes, knowing our batch
4/9/25, 6:00 PM - +91 75583 83806: Cause they might be able to decide if something you want is feasible or not...
4/9/25, 6:00 PM - +91 99100 97808: In an ideal world you wouldn't have to do this 😭
4/9/25, 6:00 PM - +91 79763 44711: i agree with you in the practical sense that it creates an image of us being unreliable, but realistically not all 370 kids want a hackathon, and even if *only* one doesn’t, that doesn’t mean he doesn’t have the right to voice his opinion
4/9/25, 6:01 PM - +91 76790 41770: look, I already wrote in my message, despite having counter perspectives here, if a moodle thread starts with a single narrative, I have to intervene.

And again, for the third time, I Won't be writing anything about ISS anymore.

There is just not enough discussion here before mail spam starts, and our batch has "unanimously" voted for dumb things before too.
4/9/25, 6:01 PM - +91 98492 33901: nobody restricted u
just speak out here
4/9/25, 6:01 PM - +91 79763 44711: speak out here so that the people in charge of actually conducting the exams never get to hear my voice?
4/9/25, 6:01 PM - +91 77450 90290: you do whatever you want then
4/9/25, 6:01 PM - +91 79763 44711: how does that work
4/9/25, 6:02 PM - +91 93445 29774: Wdym "unanimously voted for dumb things before too"
4/9/25, 6:02 PM - +91 73372 95535: ++
4/9/25, 6:02 PM - +91 98492 33901: bruh
do u really want an endsem?
4/9/25, 6:02 PM - +91 77450 90290: i will simply stop pushing for this if you want to do that bs
4/9/25, 6:02 PM - +91 79763 44711: dude
4/9/25, 6:02 PM - +91 79763 44711: .
4/9/25, 6:02 PM - +91 98492 33901: i mean its not wrong to voice ur opinion but think a bit for everyone
just don't be selfish
4/9/25, 6:03 PM - +91 79763 44711: why though? the mode of examination ultimately affect his grades and like it or not everyone is worried about their own grades first at the end of the day
4/9/25, 6:03 PM - +91 93445 29774: Dude satisfying a very small minority is actively gonna fuck up the majority
4/9/25, 6:03 PM - +91 79763 44711: if i believe an endsem will gurantee better marks for me than a hackathon, i will absolutely push for an endsem
4/9/25, 6:03 PM - +91 79763 44711: why is the majority right though?
4/9/25, 6:04 PM - +91 75583 83806: 😭😭what are we even arguing for exactly?
4/9/25, 6:04 PM - +91 79763 44711: they’re telling shuban to not voice counterpoints on moodle
4/9/25, 6:04 PM - +91 93445 29774: Here the minority has an advantage, even a single voice is enough to overturn the remaining majority, which is in my opinion way more unfair
4/9/25, 6:05 PM - +91 79763 44711: okay, that still doesn’t explain to me why you’re more right than the minority
4/9/25, 6:05 PM - +91 75583 83806: Look, in general I agree with what Shuban said, but in this scenario, talking to TAs or asking in batch group might be better
4/9/25, 6:05 PM - +91 79763 44711: you want a hackathon because it’s better for YOU, they want an endsem because it’s more right for THEM
4/9/25, 6:06 PM - +91 75583 83806: If he still has a big issue, then he can go ahead and post.
4/9/25, 6:06 PM - +91 93445 29774: It's not about right or wrong, if it's between going for the minority opinion or going for the majority opinion then yes the majority opinion should be considered more
4/9/25, 6:07 PM - +91 93445 29774: Ideally both parties should be kept happy, but that ain't an option here
4/9/25, 6:07 PM - +91 79763 44711: if 300 of us vote to murder the other 60 does that make us right lol
4/9/25, 6:07 PM - +91 79763 44711: that’s not how it works 😭
4/9/25, 6:07 PM - +91 79763 44711: this is very utilitarian
4/9/25, 6:08 PM - Poonam: it's more about the majority opinion, you're allowed to voice it out to fellow batchmates and try to change their minds but if youre not able to, you don't have the right to make moodle threads look like a shitshow civil war because then it affects credibility in front of profs
4/9/25, 6:08 PM - +91 79763 44711: everyone should have an equal right to voice their opinion, and ultimately it comes down to sai to make his choice
4/9/25, 6:09 PM - +91 93445 29774: If we're going with these silly scenarios, then let's consider a more equalised version to what's going on: Would you kill 60 people or would you kill 300 people? Each group votes for the other group to be killed
4/9/25, 6:09 PM - +91 79763 44711: yeah but the people in favor of the hackathon have clearly shown they’re not willing to compromise and do an endsem, and vice versa. if the people around you aren’t willing to listen/change, what’s your next step? talk to the people who can actually bring about change
4/9/25, 6:09 PM - Poonam: in Moodle it's not 369 mails vs 1 mail, it's 1 mail representing 369 people vs 1 mail representing a counter opinion, but on the Moodle level it just looks like the batch is indecisive
4/9/25, 6:09 PM - +91 75583 83806: Yea cause when someone makes a moodle post it sounds like a majority have a problem...
4/9/25, 6:09 PM - +91 99100 97808: Thank you^
4/9/25, 6:09 PM - +91 73372 95535: dropping this here
I don't want a hackathon if I don't get to choose my teammates. It's not fair grading if we can't choose who we want to work with.
4/9/25, 6:10 PM - +91 79763 44711: that comes down to wording then no? 

the mail with 360 people has a poll attached to it, will have multiple people supporting it and commenting

the message by one guy will clearly be his own personal opinion and not reflective of anyone else

if sai is retarded enough to not be able to tell the difference that’s on him and not us
4/9/25, 6:10 PM - +91 93445 29774: You are fully entitled to vote for what you want in the poll
4/9/25, 6:10 PM - +91 73372 95535: At least with the theory endsem it's relative and individual so it's objectively fair
4/9/25, 6:11 PM - +91 73372 95535: He wanted us to say it here before putting it on middle that's why I sent t
4/9/25, 6:11 PM - Shoaib: Fr , I don't want to be a burden to my teammates
4/9/25, 6:11 PM - +91 79763 44711: the message with 360 people backing it will ultimately have more weight because of the things attached to it, even if it’s just one message
4/9/25, 6:12 PM - +91 75583 83806: You don't want bickering and multiple moodle posts just arguing as that still makes us look bad
4/9/25, 6:12 PM - +91 79763 44711: no one telling you to fight in the comments there, but if you have an opinion you should be free to share it with a detailed explanation and reasoning
4/9/25, 6:13 PM - +91 76790 41770: come on guys calm down,

yea the reason I'd like to give out different opinion, even if minority, is to affect the credibility of the main opinion.

And it's not really valid saying 369 people 1 mail vs 1 person 1 mail, if there is a spam of majority opinion, it's evident more people want that.
The minority also has to put stuff up, just so that the prof/Tas know there are other perspectives too and we can get a best of both worlds decision.
4/9/25, 6:13 PM - +91 79763 44711: shuban (from his past comments on this) hasn’t just said “lol hackathon bad” he actually has weighted reasons and perspectives defending his opinion, and that makes it valid <This message was edited>
4/9/25, 6:13 PM - +91 93445 29774: Like ponnam says, From their perspective it makes us look indecisive. And we are arguing against the incharges who are actively I favour of the minority opinion, one message is all they need to justify their decision
4/9/25, 6:13 PM - +91 79763 44711: exactly
4/9/25, 6:14 PM - +91 79763 44711: being in the majority doesn’t automatically give you the right to enforce your policies though
4/9/25, 6:15 PM - +91 79763 44711: your point repeatedly is

we are majority
someone goes against us
majority looks weak
majority loses
4/9/25, 6:15 PM - +91 93445 29774: Yes
4/9/25, 6:15 PM - +91 79763 44711: your argument should be strong enough to the point where a counterpoint isn’t enough to break it down, and still comes out as the better option
4/9/25, 6:15 PM - +91 93445 29774: Coz that's what's happening
4/9/25, 6:15 PM - Poonam: the responsibility to compile and provide profs the most optimal request benefitting the highest number of people is of batch representatives, when you're sending multiple suggestions you're essentially putting the burden of decision making on the profs who will have to deal with this back and forth bs when it's not really their responsibility
4/9/25, 6:16 PM - Poonam: and right now, it's just 1 person whos provided counter opinions, if there's more number of ppl taking multiple opinions  directly to the profs it gets worse <This message was edited>
4/9/25, 6:17 PM - +91 99100 97808: The issue is we don't have time to flesh this out in more detail even if we wanted to, better to just let the majority be rather than let the indecision result in chaos
4/9/25, 6:17 PM - +91 79763 44711: the profs are the one structuring and organizing the course, it is ultimately their responsibility though. the fact that we are able to control the direction of this course to some extent is a miracle in and of itself, just because an argument is utilitarian doesn’t mean it should be the one put forward, yes more people might end up happy, but objectively an endsem theory paper is more fair (as much as i do NOT want it)
4/9/25, 6:18 PM - +91 79763 44711: the argument the minority makes is very fucking valid here
4/9/25, 6:18 PM - +91 98492 33901: Come on guys
Just vote for what u want 
If what u want isn't on the poll, mention it over here and discuss with everyone 
Don't just fight out on Moodle like the last time
Though it was for a hackathon, it was a war against unacceptable team formation, but pls don't repeat it
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE JUST FOR THIS ONCE
4/9/25, 6:19 PM - +91 99100 97808: Then make your case to the batch
4/9/25, 6:19 PM - +91 99100 97808: Not to the prof
4/9/25, 6:19 PM - +91 79763 44711: you and i both know everyone is set on their views and not changing them anytime soon
4/9/25, 6:19 PM - +91 99100 97808: You don't email the election commissioner if you don't like the guy getting electrd
4/9/25, 6:19 PM - +91 73372 95535: not trying to start a fight here but @919361140892 @919344529774 ur only saying all this because ur opinion aligns with the majority 

even the minority's opinions should be heard by the prof since he's the one making the final call
4/9/25, 6:19 PM - +91 99100 97808: Then that's democracy
4/9/25, 6:20 PM - +91 79763 44711: and democracy = right to protest and free speech 😭
4/9/25, 6:20 PM - +91 99100 97808: So protest who's saying don't protest
4/9/25, 6:20 PM - +91 72040 03381: He's in ece 💀
4/9/25, 6:20 PM - +91 79763 44711: writing on moodle is a form of protest
4/9/25, 6:20 PM - +91 79763 44711: eh idt that matters it’s a principle argument
4/9/25, 6:20 PM - +91 99100 97808: But emailing sai is wasting time which we don't have
4/9/25, 6:20 PM - +91 72040 03381: No no he said opinion aligns with majority
4/9/25, 6:20 PM - +91 72040 03381: So I meant it doesn't
4/9/25, 6:21 PM - +91 72040 03381: Cuz he doesn't hv a personal benefit here
4/9/25, 6:21 PM - +91 99100 97808: I'm not saying don't do it I'm saying it benefits no one
4/9/25, 6:21 PM - +91 81868 67789: If they're pissed off by the spam, Sai may give a paper in which we can't even understand a word and 20% guess off like that
Hackathon is on safer side
This is my argument <This message was edited>
4/9/25, 6:21 PM - +91 79763 44711: how does it waste time if it helps those who want the endsem paper potentially have the endsem be a paper
4/9/25, 6:21 PM - +91 79763 44711: relative grading
4/9/25, 6:21 PM - +91 76790 41770: alright guys just calm down 😭

ISS has come down to a far majority of similar opinions, after dean's hackathon rejection.

We will fight for other conflict of opinion next sem, when it happens, chill now <This message was edited>
4/9/25, 6:22 PM - +91 98492 33901: Why didn't u guys fight before this all happened?
4/9/25, 6:22 PM - +91 73372 95535: oh wait yeah why is he even here 😂
4/9/25, 6:22 PM - +91 99100 97808: I'll say no to another assignment extension dw it's been too long
4/9/25, 6:22 PM - +91 98492 33901: We had a hackathon scheduled since long ago right
4/9/25, 6:22 PM - +91 75583 83806: btw why is the ISS group locked?
4/9/25, 6:22 PM - +91 79763 44711: >person wants theory paper
>person mails sai
>sai sees counter argument to hackathon
>sai sets theory paper
>person happy
>person benefitted
4/9/25, 6:22 PM - +91 73372 95535: so people see the poll
4/9/25, 6:22 PM - +91 72040 03381: Prolly cuz of what's happening in unofficial
4/9/25, 6:22 PM - +91 80782 07252: prolly so that this fight doesnt happen there
4/9/25, 6:23 PM - +91 93445 29774: Coz ponnam is based like that
4/9/25, 6:23 PM - +91 72044 30421: WOOOOOHOOO thank you ece friend
4/9/25, 6:23 PM - +91 76790 41770: but that opinion doesn't benifit anyone?
4/9/25, 6:23 PM - +91 99100 97808: 🥰
4/9/25, 6:23 PM - +91 79763 44711: 💀💀💀💀💀
4/9/25, 6:23 PM - +91 72040 03381: What's the majority opinion here btw
4/9/25, 6:23 PM - +91 79763 44711: pro hackathon
4/9/25, 6:23 PM - +91 75583 83806: 😭😭😭
4/9/25, 6:23 PM - +91 93445 29774: Hackathon yes
4/9/25, 6:23 PM - +91 81868 67789: Bcoz this while chat will be done there spamming everyone if not locked
4/9/25, 6:23 PM - +91 72040 03381: Ohk gotcha
4/9/25, 6:24 PM - +91 99100 97808: Okay well mostly no one saving like 3 people.
4/9/25, 6:24 PM - +91 76790 41770: everyone wants project or hackathon in ISS
4/9/25, 6:24 PM - +91 79763 44711: yes but my point is those 3
people are just as valid
4/9/25, 6:24 PM - +91 74993 83040: ➕
4/9/25, 6:24 PM - +91 70085 04400: Wasn't it established that theory endsem gonna happen irrespective of hackathon or not?
4/9/25, 6:24 PM - +91 90049 84037: Hackathon
4/9/25, 6:24 PM - +91 79763 44711: thanks ece goat
4/9/25, 6:24 PM - +91 93445 29774: Yeah it's like sacrificing 360 people so that 3 people can be happy
4/9/25, 6:24 PM - +91 72044 30421: Nah tamatar sar keep up with the times🥺
4/9/25, 6:24 PM - +91 77450 90290: i am trying to push for hackathon with the prof
4/9/25, 6:24 PM - +91 76790 41770: yea
4/9/25, 6:24 PM - +91 80782 07252: it benefits him if people dont submit completed assignment
4/9/25, 6:24 PM - +91 98492 33901: ISS is a practical subject, and it doesn't work on the principle of mugging up 7-8 languages
It works on trial and error with logic
So a hackathon is a better idea
This is my argument
4/9/25, 6:24 PM - +91 93445 29774: Even ece guys agree with the majority opinion
4/9/25, 6:25 PM - +91 74993 83040: an endsem is invalid
that is kinda a bigger point no?
4/9/25, 6:25 PM - +91 79763 44711: this affects the weightage of the theory paper tho
4/9/25, 6:25 PM - +91 72040 03381: Posting individual arguments on Moodle is a horrible idea 
Regardless didn't the dean say his decision will be supplemented by the majority consensus
4/9/25, 6:25 PM - +91 70085 04400: Bas puch raha hoon dw
4/9/25, 6:25 PM - +91 72044 30421: I don't see the problem in the people who don't want a hackathon to just vote for endsem theory. You don't see the people who want a hackathon spamming on Moodle. Why should you?
4/9/25, 6:25 PM - +91 70085 04400: Okay
4/9/25, 6:25 PM - +91 72044 30421: If you want an endsem vote for the endsem. Democracy will take care of the rest
4/9/25, 6:25 PM - +91 79763 44711: but.. the plan is for them to make a moodle post though
4/9/25, 6:25 PM - +91 72044 30421: <Media omitted>
4/9/25, 6:25 PM - +91 81868 67789: This is already done due to which prof dropped off the idea
4/9/25, 6:26 PM - +91 72040 03381: What
4/9/25, 6:26 PM - +91 93445 29774: Yeah, one showcasing the poll and the votes
4/9/25, 6:26 PM - +91 72044 30421: The Moodle post will support whatever the poll supports. If the collective majority wants an endsem, the Moodle post will vouch for endsem.
4/9/25, 6:26 PM - +91 76790 41770: Well then it's all right to frame it that way,
"dear prof, if extentions are always readily provided,... blablabla this this happens... hence no extentions"
4/9/25, 6:26 PM - +91 93445 29774: Not an individual agenda
4/9/25, 6:26 PM - +91 81868 67789: That's why we're about to request the prof after making a poll
4/9/25, 6:26 PM - +91 79763 44711: the only fair way to go about is this is make a singular moodle post which argues for both sides and let sai pick, but that’s not happening
4/9/25, 6:26 PM - +91 99100 97808: Also the thing with email threads is its the last person who emails who has the biggest say
4/9/25, 6:26 PM - +91 79763 44711: get to work then buddy
4/9/25, 6:27 PM - +91 79763 44711: no sleep for you
4/9/25, 6:27 PM - +91 72044 30421: You are aggregiously misunderstanding what the Moodle post is going to do. It's going to vouch for the majority. Nothing more nothing less
4/9/25, 6:27 PM - +91 74993 83040: that is not fair
4/9/25, 6:27 PM - +91 72040 03381: What happened to democracy 💀
4/9/25, 6:27 PM - +91 70085 04400: Will Sai listen to our requests after all this fiasco? I have a feeling he'll just ask us to shut up and write end sems lol
4/9/25, 6:27 PM - +91 99100 97808: 😔
4/9/25, 6:27 PM - +91 79763 44711: yes and the point is who’s vouching for the minority 😭
4/9/25, 6:27 PM - +91 79763 44711: im not starting this argument from the beginning again, just go up and read every point has been made
4/9/25, 6:27 PM - +91 72044 30421: Vouch for yourself here, get more people on your side. Thats the way you vouch for the majority
4/9/25, 6:28 PM - +91 75583 83806: 😭😭why are we arguing this much if only 3 people want endsems?
4/9/25, 6:28 PM - +91 72044 30421: I did ra that's why I'm late. Third speaker Maxx shhh strawman mentioned uwu Owo 7 minute mark no more POIs🥺🥺🥺
4/9/25, 6:28 PM - +91 99100 97808: Who's the 3rd btw I just rounded up to 3 for funsies
4/9/25, 6:28 PM - +91 72044 30421: Cause those three people wanna Moodle max and get the rest of us raped😭
4/9/25, 6:28 PM - +91 76790 41770: who all want it btw 💀?
4/9/25, 6:28 PM - +91 79763 44711: check poll
4/9/25, 6:28 PM - +91 72044 30421: Lynch them
4/9/25, 6:28 PM - +91 75583 83806: Bro it went up to 4 just as i said this <This message was edited>
4/9/25, 6:29 PM - +91 99100 97808: I see two adityas and neither of you 💀
4/9/25, 6:29 PM - +91 93445 29774: Off to the gulag, going against the hivemind is heresy
4/9/25, 6:29 PM - +91 72044 30421: <Media omitted>
4/9/25, 6:29 PM - +91 93445 29774: Damn I now kinda understand the reasoning behind those Aditya hater reels
4/9/25, 6:30 PM - +91 76790 41770: nah, it makes sense.

they think it's double work to do endsem and hackathon.

i don't agree, but I respect all opinions which seems valid
4/9/25, 6:30 PM - +91 75583 83806: Guys what if no endsems?
4/9/25, 6:30 PM - +91 72044 30421: I don't think double will happen
4/9/25, 6:30 PM - +91 93445 29774: Wait endsem and hackathon?
4/9/25, 6:30 PM - +91 72044 30421: The way prakhar sar was talking today, he was very VERY against endsems
4/9/25, 6:30 PM - +91 76790 41770: we might be able to convince the dean?
4/9/25, 6:31 PM - +91 93445 29774: Isn't this for only hackathon
4/9/25, 6:31 PM - +91 76790 41770: nah
4/9/25, 6:31 PM - +91 72044 30421: I'm pretty sure the poll is no endsem only hackathon
4/9/25, 6:31 PM - +91 88074 94038: This message was deleted
4/9/25, 6:31 PM - +91 93445 29774: Yeah
4/9/25, 6:31 PM - +91 79763 44711: oh im very pro hackathon ill kill myself before i willingly write a theory paper
4/9/25, 6:31 PM - +91 80782 07252: wait this is for both endsem and hackathon or just the hackathon?
4/9/25, 6:31 PM - +91 93445 29774: Bhuban get ur facts straight bruh😭
4/9/25, 6:31 PM - +91 80782 07252: I thought just hackathon?
4/9/25, 6:31 PM - +91 76790 41770: yea ig
4/9/25, 6:31 PM - +91 93445 29774: It is supposed to be just hackathon
4/9/25, 6:32 PM - +91 76790 41770: but i voted for only hackathon in the first poll few days ago too, I thought it was about that
4/9/25, 6:32 PM - +91 76790 41770: 😂
4/9/25, 6:32 PM - +91 81253 19531: Right lads what the fuck did i miss
4/9/25, 6:33 PM - +91 75583 83806: Nothing

4/11/25, 9:15 AM - +91 76790 41770: I'm just waiting for the cinema to occur when 11:40 DSA class is full

4/11/25, 9:17 AM - +91 91759 77518: ok @919356351244 @916281157687 and some others and i are reliant on sports leave for that buffer
4/11/25, 9:17 AM - +91 72040 03381: 100 percent leave will be considered right? 
Like it won't be counted in the 15 percent classes we can leave
4/11/25, 9:17 AM - +91 72040 03381: ?
4/11/25, 9:18 AM - +91 91759 77518: which means reliant on nagaraju

4/11/25, 9:20 AM - +91 83743 88940: if we applied for leave this sem and it got approved, does the attendance alr get updated or does it get updated end of sem
4/11/25, 9:20 AM - +91 76790 41770: say that again, and you'll start a war
4/11/25, 9:21 AM - +91 83686 09506: end of sem
4/11/25, 9:21 AM - +91 62811 57687: end i believe
4/11/25, 9:21 AM - +91 83743 88940: Even if it got approved? So ims still shows leave for the class I missed and got leave for?
4/11/25, 9:21 AM - +91 72040 03381: Ims won't update attendance based on leave
4/11/25, 9:21 AM - +91 72040 03381: U have to manually calculate
4/11/25, 9:22 AM - +91 83743 88940: Arey yaar

4/11/25, 9:22 AM - +91 99721 89599: They will only include your leave if you are absent more than the 15 percebt
4/11/25, 9:22 AM - +91 72040 03381: But now it doesn't show anymore
4/11/25, 9:22 AM - +91 99721 89599: At end of the sem
4/11/25, 9:23 AM - +91 83743 88940: So rn I have to manually check the number of classes I’ve missed
4/11/25, 9:23 AM - +91 72040 03381: Yep

4/11/25, 9:23 AM - +91 91759 77518: unfortunately your attendance guy is not very nice about this
4/11/25, 9:24 AM - +91 83686 09506: we are not locked out of sh3
4/11/25, 9:25 AM - +91 83686 09506: we are locked out of the block😭

4/11/25, 9:26 AM - +91 62811 57687: is there an attendance guy guarding the door?
4/11/25, 9:26 AM - +91 91759 77518: he instructed the attendance guy not to open it i believe
4/11/25, 9:26 AM - +91 83743 88940: </3
4/11/25, 9:26 AM - +91 62811 57687: oh fuck
4/11/25, 9:26 AM - +91 72040 03381: At what point will this college realise that if they have to go thru such dramatic measures to enforce this maybe there's a fundamental issue w the attendance policy as a whole
Like this is lowkey funny the behaviour of a "tier one" institute locking people out and monitoring the doors
4/11/25, 9:27 AM - +91 91759 77518: its depressing, retarded and absolutely avoids the problem of bad scheduling and useless classes
4/11/25, 9:27 AM - +91 76790 41770: the only thing teir 1 about this college is my sleeping schedule
4/11/25, 9:27 AM - +91 91759 77518: but hey not like itll ever get fixed right
4/11/25, 9:27 AM - +91 91759 77518: sec a people
4/11/25, 9:27 AM - +91 91759 77518: last resort

4/11/25, 9:28 AM - +91 98492 33901: Wrong time mb
4/11/25, 9:28 AM - +91 72040 03381: For a college that gives so much jurisdiction for profs to decide the regulations for the class, one could argue that according to the current prof of the course we were on time 
Because he was lenient with timing
4/11/25, 9:28 AM - +91 93445 29774: This entire scenario is really funny when you aren't in any class
4/11/25, 9:28 AM - +91 83743 88940: Idt sir gives a fuck
4/11/25, 9:28 AM - +91 91759 77518: and from sec a
4/11/25, 9:29 AM - +91 74978 08993: Follow up saying they are very sorry about the same
4/11/25, 9:29 AM - +91 72040 03381: Each prof has their own policies right
4/11/25, 9:29 AM - +91 83743 88940: SAME LOMAO
4/11/25, 9:29 AM - +91 72040 03381: About attendance, punctuality
4/11/25, 9:29 AM - +91 99003 73186: Put a poll to find how many are on the verge of a drop. Then accordingly we can decide to ask bro
4/11/25, 9:29 AM - +91 74978 08993: No harm trying
4/11/25, 9:29 AM - +91 74978 08993: Just ask na
4/11/25, 9:29 AM - +91 91759 77518: bro he’ll kick that person out
4/11/25, 9:29 AM - +91 99003 73186: Bruh it's scary af and it's only worth it if there's a decent number of ppl on a grade drop
4/11/25, 9:29 AM - +91 91759 77518: zero tryst

4/11/25, 9:30 AM - +91 98492 33901: Is this absent counter?
4/11/25, 9:30 AM - +91 91759 77518: yeah
4/11/25, 9:30 AM - +91 99003 73186: Ya
4/11/25, 9:30 AM - +91 90049 84037: how long does it take for leaves to get approved, its been two weeks for me
4/11/25, 9:30 AM - +91 83743 88940: That’s there but one could also argue that we singed up for this, knowing the attendance policy and we know that we’re “supposed” to be on time to class and we just take advantage of their leniency of timings
4/11/25, 9:30 AM - +91 74978 08993: Okay, only people who are not in any class, vote
4/11/25, 9:30 AM - +91 93445 29774: I'm using half of my attendances just to be at home lol

4/11/25, 9:31 AM - +91 62811 57687: bro the two attendance guys didnt let me open the door i tried being cheeky and saying i need to fill the bottle
4/11/25, 9:31 AM - +91 72040 03381: In the words of the deputy acads dean himself 
"Academic policy is a loose guideline, profs decide for their course"
4/11/25, 9:31 AM - +91 91759 77518: didnt work na

4/11/25, 9:34 AM - +91 83743 88940: Was it informed that it’ll be lini
4/11/25, 9:34 AM - +91 77450 90290: I'll go to acads office today about the 3rd april thing, too many ppl are absent for it to be a personal issue
4/11/25, 9:34 AM - +91 90049 84037: no
4/11/25, 9:34 AM - +91 91759 77518: theyll let people out not in
4/11/25, 9:34 AM - +91 90049 84037: tysm
4/11/25, 9:34 AM - +91 70759 70819: Lmao i love how you remember this line it's so iconic
4/11/25, 9:35 AM - +91 99003 73186: They're not really supposed to inform us when it's lini tho. Like we're supposed to be on tym
4/11/25, 9:35 AM - +91 72040 03381: How could one forget
4/11/25, 9:35 AM - +91 91759 77518: they informed last time iirc
4/11/25, 9:35 AM - +91 99059 03274: doesn’t mean that they have to every time
4/11/25, 9:35 AM - +91 91759 77518: true
4/11/25, 9:36 AM - +91 77450 90290: also you can do as much bitching as you want about the attendance policy, its not going to change unfortunately
please do not go to the dean or acads office with your complaints, the reasons i am seeing on this group will get you laughed out of the office and give our batch a bad name at least when it comes to this
4/11/25, 9:36 AM - +91 91759 77518: youre being kinda unhelpful though so if your point is just to berate other people exit the discussion

4/11/25, 11:10 AM - Poonam: but damn crazy
4/11/25, 11:10 AM - +91 91759 77518: for dsa yeah we have an absence
4/11/25, 11:10 AM - +91 72040 03381: Wait will they check sections for previous attendances now
4/11/25, 11:10 AM - +91 91759 77518: lini is a good prof but this is a bit cruel
4/11/25, 11:10 AM - +91 91759 77518: hopefully not
4/11/25, 11:11 AM - +91 72044 30421: Yeah what's stopping me from putting and cutting😭
4/11/25, 11:11 AM - +91 99003 73186: Lol ya i was thinking the same
4/11/25, 11:11 AM - +91 93450 31519: Kshitij my goat
4/11/25, 11:11 AM - +91 72044 30421: ++ let's me sleep first bench
4/11/25, 11:11 AM - Poonam: once your attendance is marked theyll drag you in and lock the door and you have no choice than to listen to her 🔥
4/11/25, 11:11 AM - +91 99003 73186: Lmao
4/11/25, 11:11 AM - +91 72044 30421: I have only one counterargument for thus
4/11/25, 11:12 AM - +91 72044 30421: "W A S H R O O M"
4/11/25, 11:12 AM - Shoaib: This attendance policy of lini is so retarded
4/11/25, 11:12 AM - Shoaib: Gajjar is goated, secure about his teaching capabilities
4/11/25, 11:12 AM - Poonam: lini prolly sat down and figured out a way to fuck over the most number of people possible
4/11/25, 11:12 AM - +91 72044 30421: People still sit in his class also big W
4/11/25, 11:13 AM - Shoaib: Yup cause he teaches good
4/11/25, 11:13 AM - Shoaib: Lini also teaches good but she shouldn't be this strict with timings
4/11/25, 11:13 AM - Shoaib: It looks really immature
4/11/25, 11:14 AM - +91 91759 77518: i mean discipline is a reasonable expectation
4/11/25, 11:14 AM - +91 91759 77518: we were disciplined w her timings in H1
4/11/25, 11:14 AM - +91 91759 77518: the issue is w not informing that today’s lini
4/11/25, 11:14 AM - +91 99416 37224: On the other hand, Lini was not interested in doing this today
4/11/25, 11:14 AM - +91 91759 77518: and then lini deciding to ensure that people _cannot_ attend her class if they didnt in the morning slot
4/11/25, 11:14 AM - +91 99416 37224: She waited until 9:40, then she saw that there were only 40 students
4/11/25, 11:15 AM - +91 99416 37224: Incl. seniors
4/11/25, 11:15 AM - +91 81253 19531: So much for PJN saying college is for exploring your interests and then smacking us with 85% attendance crap
4/11/25, 11:15 AM - Shoaib: But it just feels wrong to school college students who are grown enough to figure out what's good for them
4/11/25, 11:15 AM - +91 91759 77518: it would have been a lot better for every single person for them to just conduct today’s 11:40 class in a lecture hall
4/11/25, 11:15 AM - +91 91759 77518: iiit schools us by forcing arts, sports and class attendance
4/11/25, 11:16 AM - +91 91759 77518: we’re in a glorified boarding school with the only nice factor being no locked gate
4/11/25, 11:16 AM - Shoaib: Fr I hate these extra credits
4/11/25, 11:16 AM - Shoaib: 😞😞
4/11/25, 11:16 AM - +91 91759 77518: and im pretty sure this is only so that they are not bad mouthed and so that suicides are fewer and easier to cover up
4/11/25, 11:17 AM - +91 81253 19531: Conspiracy theory that IIIT is run by therapists who want to make a quick buck
4/11/25, 11:20 AM - +91 81253 19531: Unrelated but mess ka last  controversy hoke bahut time hogaya
4/11/25, 11:20 AM - +91 93450 31519: They'll let you in right? Just no attendance? <This message was edited>
4/11/25, 11:21 AM - +91 76790 41770: only one way to know
4/11/25, 11:25 AM - +91 91191 99815: IIIT:
~Allow time for sports~
Force timings for sports
4/11/25, 11:25 AM - +91 99003 73186: Tbf most of us wld have 0 physical activity if they didn't force it upon us
4/11/25, 11:26 AM - +91 91759 77518: and? it isn’t their responsibility to force it upon us
4/11/25, 11:26 AM - +91 91759 77518: in fact
4/11/25, 11:26 AM - +91 91191 99815: I still don't understand why we can not have attendance in other slots, like bruh, I came for sports that's what you want from us, right?
4/11/25, 11:26 AM - +91 91759 77518: i’d argue that excellent sports facilities and good returns upon sports participation is a fantastically better way to encourage sports
4/11/25, 11:26 AM - +91 91759 77518: rather than have people run in circles
4/11/25, 11:26 AM - +91 91191 99815: I mean you can always sneak in, but they don't officially allow it so..
4/11/25, 11:27 AM - +91 91759 77518: has anybody who didnt play sports before improved/liked/begun a sport due to this circus bs?

4/11/25, 11:28 AM - +91 91759 77518: valid 💀
4/11/25, 11:31 AM - +91 91191 99815: Their only argument for that is overcrowding in a slot, and thus running out of equipments 
But that won't happen everyday?! Happens only when the end of semester is close and everybody wants attendance
4/11/25, 11:32 AM - +91 90049 84037: there was a fly in the south mess custard just two weeks ago br

4/11/25, 4:08 PM - Eashaan Thakur: Can we book flights from 7th may onwards? All of our exams will be over by then right?
4/11/25, 4:09 PM - +91 63541 09703: Yep but u might want to stay for paper showing.. if that's lite then it should be over

4/11/25, 5:21 PM - +91 72859 06873: when will we get the question bank though
4/11/25, 5:21 PM - +91 81868 67789: same doubt
4/11/25, 5:22 PM - Ojas Kataria: Imagine if the question bank is like 200 questions
4/11/25, 5:23 PM - +91 81868 67789: imagine doing DSA in Assembly
That's for sure tho <This message was edited>
4/11/25, 5:35 PM - +91 83686 09506: it is 12 questions only afaik😭
4/11/25, 5:35 PM - +91 63541 09703: @917010674428 pls lets not give the ta's ideas to make the lab harder
4/11/25, 5:35 PM - +91 63541 09703: 😭😭
4/11/25, 5:36 PM - +91 70106 74428: how does it make the lab harder
4/11/25, 5:36 PM - +91 63541 09703: cuz then we don't know the difficulty level
4/11/25, 5:37 PM - +91 70106 74428: but the purpose of a lab exam is to test practical skills
4/11/25, 5:37 PM - +91 70106 74428: and by giving the question bank in advance, u are just making it obsolete
4/11/25, 5:37 PM - +91 73372 95535: ur making ts harder for the rest of us
4/11/25, 5:38 PM - +91 63541 09703: I agree but not all of us are sushils so give us a chance :)
4/11/25, 5:38 PM - +91 77450 90290: last year it was only 9 qs apparently
4/11/25, 5:38 PM - +91 63541 09703: sir people here have cleared jee 💀
4/11/25, 5:38 PM - +91 63541 09703: all im saying is new war
4/11/25, 5:39 PM - +91 70106 74428: didn't intend to do any mode-of-admission based discrimination 💀
4/11/25, 5:39 PM - +91 77450 90290: I'm afraid you might have just started that lmao <This message was edited>
4/11/25, 5:40 PM - +91 70106 74428: let them set easier questions, the thing is to just not give them in advance
4/11/25, 5:41 PM - +91 73372 95535: why do you care whether they give a question bank or not??
4/11/25, 5:41 PM - +91 70106 74428: it's like giving the questions of all graded dsa labs beforehand
4/11/25, 5:41 PM - +91 99992 36203: what if you don’t see the question bank and go give the lab exam
4/11/25, 5:42 PM - +91 99003 73186: Bruh what
4/11/25, 5:42 PM - +91 73372 95535: the reason they're giving the questions is because they're testing our assembly skills not dsa skills but the questions are dsa-ish
4/11/25, 5:42 PM - +91 73372 95535: so stop trying to increase our workload
4/11/25, 5:42 PM - Eashaan Thakur: This
4/11/25, 5:42 PM - +91 70106 74428: im pretty sure people here can memorize 50 lines of assembly
4/11/25, 5:43 PM - +91 63541 09703: logic banana isn't the point here.. to write the code in assembly is so humari cg kam mat karwa aur bhi💀 <This message was edited>
4/11/25, 5:43 PM - Eashaan Thakur: Let it be there loss na, why do you care?
4/11/25, 5:43 PM - +91 73372 95535: yeah exactly stfu
4/11/25, 5:43 PM - +91 72044 30421: WOOOHOOOOOOOO
4/11/25, 5:43 PM - Shoaib: Man just let me give the exams
4/11/25, 5:44 PM - +91 74836 18341: i propose Chennai express
4/11/25, 5:44 PM - +91 70106 74428: so lets just give dsa graded lab questions beforehand?
4/11/25, 5:44 PM - +91 63541 09703: yeah works for me
4/11/25, 5:44 PM - +91 74836 18341: Yes please 🙏
4/11/25, 5:44 PM - +91 99003 73186: Yessir 🔥🔥
4/11/25, 5:44 PM - +91 77450 90290: tujhe kya jarurat hai bhai tera toh chatgpt hai na lab mein
4/11/25, 5:45 PM - +91 70106 74428: at the end of the day it's relative grading, so the practical component needs to be evaluated properly if it has to be a fair game
4/11/25, 5:45 PM - +91 99003 73186: What
4/11/25, 5:45 PM - +91 63541 09703: This message was deleted

4/11/25, 5:46 PM - +91 63541 09703: I was pressured
4/11/25, 5:46 PM - Eashaan Thakur: Don't make it seem like you already don't know all the DSA lab questions, sure the dataset is bigger but you've already done similar problems before right?
4/11/25, 5:46 PM - Shoaib: Yess
4/11/25, 5:46 PM - Sarah Roomi: but wont a person who can memorise a lot benefit against someone who actually understands the concepts but cant memorise utna..?
4/11/25, 5:46 PM - +91 63541 09703: idk sides of a coin I would sya - jisko logic ban rha hai usko karne do, jisse nahi ho rha vo rat lo ? idk <This message was edited>
4/11/25, 5:46 PM - +91 77450 90290: that doesn't make sense lol
if you're given the questions beforehand you'll just mug up the syntax and go.. thats what happened last year
4/11/25, 5:46 PM - +91 72044 30421: What's the problem if they test my memorization skills though? Let them no🤓🤓
4/11/25, 5:46 PM - +91 74836 18341: MAJIGGE

4/11/25, 5:47 PM - +91 72044 30421: Regardless of the competition bro is coming first anyways there's no loss for him anyways🫡🫡
4/11/25, 5:48 PM - +91 70106 74428: ok bro lets not have exams only then, give everyone A grade and 10 cg, lets make the world a happier place 🥰
4/11/25, 5:48 PM - +91 74978 08993: 🍿
4/11/25, 5:48 PM - +91 77450 90290: imo i agree with sushil, giving the questions beforehand makes no sense
but in the interest of not seeing 90% of the batch fail cso, i will keep my mouth shut on the course groups lmao
4/11/25, 5:48 PM - +91 77450 90290: tu ruk agle saal 😂😂
4/11/25, 5:49 PM - +91 74978 08993: (I don't have CSO)
4/11/25, 5:49 PM - +91 74978 08993: I don't care about grading pattern anymore
4/11/25, 5:49 PM - +91 72044 30421: Thank u guruji you are a responsible kassi representative
4/11/25, 5:49 PM - +91 74978 08993: Or grades in general
4/11/25, 5:50 PM - +91 72044 30421: <Media omitted>
4/11/25, 5:50 PM - +91 74836 18341: The lab exam itself is stupid, why should you be expected to write assembly? We have compilers for that
4/11/25, 5:50 PM - +91 77450 90290: ey thats the point of the course we can't argue on that lmao
4/11/25, 5:50 PM - +91 77450 90290: also when else will you simdeeze
4/11/25, 5:50 PM - +91 74836 18341: Instead the exam should be writing a rust compiler for the architecture discussed in pjns class
4/11/25, 5:50 PM - +91 74836 18341: Port llvm obv
4/11/25, 5:50 PM - +91 72044 30421: The subject itself is stupid. 99 percent of the exam is rote learning anyways. All of it can be looked up nowadays. Why learn CSO at all? <This message was edited>
4/11/25, 5:51 PM - +91 74836 18341: Its trivial.
4/11/25, 5:51 PM - +91 77450 90290: he doesn't even have the course 😭 he's trolling
4/11/25, 5:51 PM - +91 74836 18341: Complete with async trait support ofc
4/11/25, 5:51 PM - +91 72044 30421: At this point I don't either da😭
4/11/25, 5:52 PM - +91 91005 97546: Bhai kyu pehle se hi it’s been hectic for people like me (not all) it’s been the same for last few years why do you people wanna change not all can manage c,cpp, iss and assembly too at least im dumb enough to give up on everything, pata chala end mein questions tough hai laude lag gaye toh

4/11/25, 5:55 PM - +91 93445 29774: I also agree with Sushil, giving free 10 cg to everyone has no reason to be scrutinized
4/11/25, 5:57 PM - +91 74836 18341: Everyone should get a 10 cg so that we do not fight a war amongst ourselves and take down the bourgeois administration in a bloody and holy class war
4/11/25, 5:57 PM - +91 81253 19531: Yall dense asf icl theres free marks up for grabs. You dont even have to memorize you just have to... understand how to do it.
4/11/25, 5:58 PM - +91 99416 37224: Students of the world, unite!
4/11/25, 5:58 PM - +91 81253 19531: Those who want to memorize 600 lines of assembly will memorize those who want to understand will understand those who want to go in blind will go in blind lmao
4/11/25, 6:00 PM - +91 81253 19531: This is like the first open goal we're getting this entire sem do you want the keeper to snatch the ball from your feet lmao
4/11/25, 6:03 PM - +91 70085 04400: Avg chd person:

4/11/25, 6:12 PM - +91 72044 30421: I don't get why olympiad sama chans don't want us to get the marks😭
4/11/25, 6:12 PM - +91 72044 30421: To someone who gets 100 how does it matter if the peasants get 40 or 60😭
4/11/25, 6:13 PM - +91 73372 95535: they've already done the dsa part so for them it doesn't make a difference 

they're trying to fuck over the rest of the batch so their relative grade increases
4/11/25, 6:13 PM - +91 73372 95535: shameful behaviour
4/11/25, 6:14 PM - Shoaib: Type of ppl to elect trump

4/11/25, 6:17 PM - +91 81253 19531: The leopards want to eat everyone's face
4/11/25, 6:17 PM - +91 96772 32382: I mean, if they give the problems away we would have to spend a lot of time working on the solutions. that is a lot of time wasted. if the problems aren't given, just spend some x time working on the syntax and go to the exam.
4/11/25, 6:18 PM - +91 70439 27535: Since when is PEC not taking manual attendance?
4/11/25, 6:18 PM - +91 76790 41770: Bruh are peeps actually fighting because of CSO question bank
4/11/25, 6:18 PM - +91 74836 18341: You don't have to spend time on the problems, you can just look at the syntax and go
4/11/25, 6:18 PM - +91 93445 29774: Kassi mfs
4/11/25, 6:19 PM - +91 96772 32382: i don't know enough assembly to trust myself to do that

4/11/25, 6:32 PM - +91 72044 30421: Haan so you do that no daaa why drag me down😭
4/11/25, 6:33 PM - +91 96772 32382: ...
4/11/25, 6:38 PM - +91 72044 30421: Hari you know more assembly than 99 percent of the population here😭
4/11/25, 6:40 PM - +91 96772 32382: I learnt it along with the course only 😭
4/11/25, 6:41 PM - +91 72044 30421: Okay you know DSA no? If they ask DSA based questions (like they do in the assignments) then you'd have an advantage nooo? So let rattamaxx people have an advantage here noooo <This message was edited>
4/11/25, 6:41 PM - +91 99100 97808: I mean I honestly don't think there's any point in solving a problem in assembly directly, what they should be testing is your ability to optimise assembly code 
Like given this code try and figure out how to reduce the number of lines of code, and you're given marks based on the number you reduce
It's not DSA 2.0 so why treat it like it
4/11/25, 6:41 PM - +91 99100 97808: You're arguing for the wrong thing imo
4/11/25, 6:42 PM - +91 72044 30421: Arguing at all is wrong here. Why do something that'll harm everyone in the batch but you?
4/11/25, 6:42 PM - +91 96772 32382: I would say removing the lab exam would work then
4/11/25, 6:42 PM - +91 96772 32382: an assignment would do the trick
4/11/25, 6:42 PM - +91 99100 97808: Real but it's free marks
4/11/25, 6:42 PM - +91 72044 30421: If you are really for standing up for academic integrity of the course or what not then that's simply not your job. If the prof doesn't give a fuck why should you😭
4/11/25, 6:42 PM - +91 96772 32382: I don't want to spend time trying 11 problems -_-
4/11/25, 6:42 PM - +91 72044 30421: You don't need to no da you can already dsa max it and study and go like you would if the TAs chose your side🥺
4/11/25, 6:43 PM - +91 96772 32382: maybe suggest this 🤔
4/11/25, 6:43 PM - +91 96772 32382: assembly syntax too weird
4/11/25, 6:43 PM - +91 99100 97808: Whenever we have tried to change something in a course structure it has only come to bite us in the ass
4/11/25, 6:43 PM - +91 99100 97808: Let us not.
4/11/25, 6:43 PM - +91 74978 08993: Is just complicated C, ~or say C++~ 😂
4/11/25, 6:44 PM - +91 80782 07252: iss 😭
4/11/25, 6:44 PM - +91 96772 32382: deepak honestly seems like a much better guy than sai
4/11/25, 6:44 PM - +91 74978 08993: At least one can't get 100%+ in Sai's course
4/11/25, 6:44 PM - +91 96772 32382: wtf, you haven't taken the course so -_-
4/11/25, 6:44 PM - +91 72040 03381: I read that as deepseek
4/11/25, 6:45 PM - +91 72044 30421: deepseek is also a much better guy than sai
4/11/25, 6:46 PM - +91 81253 19531: sai is literally an AI
4/11/25, 6:47 PM - +91 81253 19531: He has no mindpower of his own, he inputs everything into an LLM and takes its advice
4/11/25, 6:47 PM - +91 72040 03381: Wait why do we hate sai again? He's making us write code in assembly?
4/11/25, 6:48 PM - +91 81253 19531: Is this not ISS Sai?
4/11/25, 6:48 PM - +91 72040 03381: Iss sai
4/11/25, 6:48 PM - +91 74978 08993: People, take things lite
4/11/25, 6:48 PM - +91 81253 19531: ISS Sai hackathon endsem fuck up midsem quiz 1 quiz 2 website labs
4/11/25, 6:49 PM - +91 74978 08993: No point arguing and ranting on things you can't do anything about
4/11/25, 6:51 PM - +91 96772 32382: <Media omitted>
4/11/25, 6:51 PM - +91 77450 90290: convince ppl not to leave the class.. talking to the prof will just result in you listening to an unskippable cutscene
4/11/25, 6:52 PM - +91 63541 09703: afaik it was the seniors who left
4/11/25, 6:52 PM - +91 77450 90290: yup ;_;
4/11/25, 6:52 PM - +91 93563 51244: Cso?
4/11/25, 6:52 PM - +91 96772 32382: first part ain't going to happen lmao
4/11/25, 6:52 PM - +91 76790 41770: btw for CSO also the prof might suddenly get strict, so come on time for everything
4/11/25, 6:52 PM - +91 96772 32382: like how do you even do it
4/11/25, 6:52 PM - +91 96772 32382: Section A exists 🫠
4/11/25, 6:52 PM - +91 77450 90290: i know some of the seniors so i was going to try and talk to them
4/11/25, 6:52 PM - +91 77450 90290: we'll see how that goes lmao
4/11/25, 6:52 PM - Ayush: To the people who leave cso class right after attendance please sleep or start doomscrollin
4/11/25, 6:53 PM - +91 63541 09703: upon that the thing is we would be talking to seniors
4/11/25, 6:53 PM - +91 96772 32382: but I am p sure he is already pissed
4/11/25, 6:53 PM - +91 77450 90290: yes he is
4/11/25, 6:53 PM - +91 77450 90290: tas were clear about that
4/11/25, 6:53 PM - +91 96772 32382: so unless we speak to him about it, he might still give bad grades
4/11/25, 6:53 PM - Ayush: Literally anything is better than infuriating a prof
4/11/25, 6:54 PM - +91 77450 90290: what do you want to go and say to him tho
4/11/25, 6:54 PM - +91 72044 30421: Pls forgive us sir our batch is retarded sir pls
4/11/25, 6:55 PM - +91 74978 08993: Best thing you guys can do is to go to CSO class on time, all of you for the next three lectures and participate in class
4/11/25, 6:55 PM - +91 74978 08993: Believe me, it will sort things out a lot
4/11/25, 6:55 PM - +91 96772 32382: something along the lines: the TAs told you were upset about it. really sorry about that but that was a small part of the batch and primarily seniors. We would make sure this doesn't happen again and if it does we'll personally report that to you.
4/11/25, 6:55 PM - +91 74978 08993: But only if you all do this
4/11/25, 6:56 PM - +91 77450 90290: snitching on seniors eh
4/11/25, 6:56 PM - +91 63541 09703: when the seniors left, the prof asked them to like stay.. he said excuse me and all but they ignored and left and he told us specifically that he will find those students and told us to inform them that "if those ppl see a drop in their grade, nothing will be done"
4/11/25, 6:56 PM - +91 63541 09703: now im hoping he meant only those students
4/11/25, 6:56 PM - Ayush: Yeh
4/11/25, 6:56 PM - +91 99416 37224: Is moodle down or smth?
4/11/25, 6:56 PM - +91 77450 90290: he probably did
4/11/25, 6:56 PM - Ayush: I think he meant a drop for them only because he stated he would find them
4/11/25, 6:56 PM - +91 77450 90290: you could do this ig
4/11/25, 6:56 PM - +91 77450 90290: maybe leave out the personally report part
4/11/25, 6:57 PM - +91 72044 30421: Not a bad idea, what they gonna do?
4/11/25, 6:57 PM - +91 63541 09703: yeah so all im saying is it a good idea to tell the prof that we think that he will screw our grades?
4/11/25, 6:57 PM - +91 96772 32382: hmm, if we tell him it won't happen again and they do it what do we do at that point
4/11/25, 6:57 PM - +91 77450 90290: 🤷 fair enough
4/11/25, 6:57 PM - +91 96772 32382: nwe never mention about grades
4/11/25, 6:57 PM - +91 63541 09703: thy can be our ta's next sem
4/11/25, 6:57 PM - +91 74978 08993: @917745090290 dekh liyo, if you feel there's a need and prof is quite pissed off, just send it on announcements group and try to make it happen
4/11/25, 6:58 PM - +91 63541 09703: makes sense
4/11/25, 6:58 PM - +91 77450 90290: I'll go talk to them
4/11/25, 6:58 PM - +91 77450 90290: I'll do that anyways if i see them today
4/11/25, 6:58 PM - +91 77450 90290: who are the seniors in section a?
4/11/25, 6:58 PM - +91 63541 09703: cnd <This message was edited>

4/11/25, 6:59 PM - +91 96772 32382: <Media omitted>
4/11/25, 6:59 PM - +91 99416 37224: I've seen both CHD seniors and UG-1s leave lmao
4/11/25, 6:59 PM - +91 77450 90290: not really, because only like 30 ppl show up to class
4/11/25, 6:59 PM - +91 74978 08993: By the way, after today's DSA incident, I think our grades are gonna be quite bad this sem in all subjects
4/11/25, 6:59 PM - +91 63541 09703: oki
4/11/25, 6:59 PM - +91 99416 37224: What incident 💀
4/11/25, 6:59 PM - Ayush: That don't make it any better dawg 😭
4/11/25, 6:59 PM - +91 63541 09703: class attendance thing
4/11/25, 6:59 PM - +91 74978 08993: 30 people on time
4/11/25, 6:59 PM - +91 99416 37224: Ah, that
4/11/25, 6:59 PM - +91 99003 73186: Depends on which prof grades
4/11/25, 7:00 PM - +91 74978 08993: DSA, lini only
4/11/25, 7:00 PM - +91 99100 97808: I'm there to help vedant doing my part
4/11/25, 7:00 PM - +91 99003 73186: Bruh
4/11/25, 7:00 PM - +91 99416 37224: Mam got pissed real quick, sorry state of affairs
4/11/25, 7:00 PM - Ayush: What happened?
4/11/25, 7:00 PM - +91 99003 73186: How u so sure ?
4/11/25, 7:00 PM - +91 74978 08993: She is a senior prof., so
4/11/25, 7:00 PM - +91 93988 38711: Yeah 
Anyone would be pissed if you would walk away on their face
4/11/25, 7:00 PM - +91 77450 90290: he was even fine with ppl coming 10 15 minutes late but ppl were walking in after 50 minutes lol
4/11/25, 7:01 PM - +91 93988 38711: True….
4/11/25, 7:01 PM - +91 93988 38711: And leaving just after attendance
4/11/25, 7:01 PM - +91 74978 08993: In a nutshell, our image as a batch is too bad in front of administration as of now and all the profs. are now pissed off, so don't expect a good grading, at least for the larger courses. <This message was edited>
4/11/25, 7:03 PM - +91 93988 38711: Plus we are asking them to change this and that every next second
4/11/25, 7:03 PM - +91 74978 08993: Yes, that's even worse
4/11/25, 7:04 PM - +91 99100 97808: Please don't say atleast for the larger courses when every course I have is a larger course 😭
4/11/25, 7:05 PM - +91 74978 08993: See, CND profs (except you know whom) don't care that much. They are quite chill
4/11/25, 7:05 PM - +91 81253 19531: Sooo how fucked are we
4/11/25, 7:05 PM - +91 93988 38711: Lol true 😂
4/11/25, 7:05 PM - +91 81253 19531: Truly everyone is a UG1 hater
4/11/25, 7:05 PM - Ayush: Real madrid
4/11/25, 7:05 PM - +91 81253 19531: Oh noo
4/11/25, 7:05 PM - +91 80782 07252: skill issue pratush
4/11/25, 7:05 PM - +91 81253 19531: <Media omitted>
4/11/25, 7:05 PM - +91 74978 08993: Profs, admin, seniors all
4/11/25, 7:06 PM - +91 81253 19531: I didnt do shit its yall fault smh /j
4/11/25, 7:06 PM - +91 93988 38711: Okay profs I get , was never able to get why seniors ??
4/11/25, 7:06 PM - +91 81253 19531: We're annoying as fuck lmao
4/11/25, 7:07 PM - +91 81253 19531: And they just haters (UG2 peeps)
4/11/25, 7:07 PM - +91 81253 19531: Trust me a good amount of seniors who hate us are those losers who stay stuck in their rooms and dont touch grass
4/11/25, 7:08 PM - +91 81253 19531: Otherwise most of them are solid
4/11/25, 7:08 PM - Ayush: Not a good look on your digital footprint
4/11/25, 7:09 PM - +91 81253 19531: My brother in christ there is WAY WORSE on my digital footprint
4/11/25, 7:10 PM - Ayush: But tbf we can be really annoying especially annoying during paper checking, TAs look like they hate their lives even if I'm polite so
4/11/25, 7:11 PM - +91 81253 19531: See the thing is
4/11/25, 7:12 PM - +91 81253 19531: EVERYONE AND THEIR MUM HATES US FOR 75% PERFECTLY VALID REASONS
4/11/25, 7:12 PM - +91 81253 19531: AND THESE MFS HAVE THE POWER TO FUCK US UP *BAD*
4/11/25, 7:12 PM - +91 81253 19531: Its like pushing a referee
4/11/25, 7:12 PM - +91 81253 19531: LETS NOT FUCK UP ANY MORE plz
4/11/25, 7:13 PM - +91 81253 19531: Otherwise 85% will be the fail percentage not the attendance requirement
4/11/25, 7:17 PM - +91 74978 08993: For example, ISS TAs are also quite pissed off because none of us appreciate the amount of work they are doing. While I agree they are being paid, you guys don't appreciate the effort they are putting into making lab activities and all. A little appreciation and adjustment is all it takes.
They have told me multiple times how angry they are at the batch. Consider that, the endsem paper showing will be done by then only.

This is just an example, this was done by us in other courses as well.
4/11/25, 7:18 PM - +91 99003 73186: It's similar for Zia and AEC as well. He gonna cook us in his grading 😔
4/11/25, 7:27 PM - +91 74836 18341: don't glaze the bourgeoisie
4/11/25, 7:31 PM - +91 90049 84037: Fr😭😭
4/11/25, 7:56 PM - +91 90919 29888: Bro that doesn't fucking mean you don't give him feedback at _ALL_
4/11/25, 7:57 PM - +91 90919 29888: I'm not gonna just shut up about a prof no matter how bad he is JUST because he "has good grading"
4/11/25, 7:57 PM - +91 90919 29888: Of course I don't mean you have to shit on the prof but constructive criticism is still important
4/11/25, 7:57 PM - +91 80782 07252: not everyone has greeeat marks like u da
4/11/25, 7:58 PM - +91 90919 29888: the point is if you give him feedback he'll atleast try to change something about how things have been happening, which may just end up helping the rest of the batch too
4/11/25, 7:59 PM - +91 93445 29774: Yeah we all know what happens when kassis get involved
4/11/25, 7:59 PM - +91 90919 29888: You can't just be like "oh lite I have to do it all myself let the prof just give good grading" cause half of the shit Zia teaches I couldn't even find outside until very recently
4/11/25, 8:00 PM - +91 74978 08993: Give feedback by mailing the prof, meeting in person
4/11/25, 8:00 PM - +91 90919 29888: Or by filling the feedback form
4/11/25, 8:00 PM - +91 74836 18341: Damn how did we let the E*X fuckers take over our banter
4/11/25, 8:00 PM - +91 74978 08993: That works
4/11/25, 8:01 PM - +91 90919 29888: Yeah exactly
4/11/25, 8:01 PM - +91 90919 29888: The feedback form is meant for this
4/11/25, 8:04 PM - +91 90919 29888: if anything he probably cares more if people participate in class or not, and is more pissed off by that
4/11/25, 8:16 PM - +91 78424 72826: Guys
4/11/25, 8:16 PM - +91 78424 72826: Gayme night

4/12/25, 1:34 AM - +91 72044 30421: null
4/12/25, 1:34 AM - Auditorium: 💀💀💀
4/12/25, 1:45 AM - +91 72044 30421: *💥📩 YOU’VE BEEN SUMMONED, CHRONIC SCROLLER 📩💥*  
🚨 *This is not a drill. This is a digitally transmitted stroke.* 🚨  

Oxford University Press declared “**brainrot**” the Word of the Year 2024.  
_And TVRQC took that personally._

Thus arrives:  
🧠✨ **THE BRAINROT + MEMES QUIZ** ✨🧠  
_(aka: "The only place where your crippling screen addiction might actually pay off.")_

📍 *Location:* H205  
🗓️ *Date:* 15th April  
⏰ *Time:* 9PM  
💸 *Prize Pool:* ₹3500 (enough to buy one BBL Grimace Shake and 3 weeks of therapy)


THIS QUIZ IS NOT FOR:  
🚫 People who still touch grass  
🚫 Anyone who thinks “Fanum” is a brand of washing machine  
🚫 NPCs who read the news instead of Skibidi Toilet lore wikis  

THIS QUIZ *IS* FOR:  
✅ Those who use CapCut audio to explain the Cold War  
✅ People who hallucinated John Pork during a 4AM doomscroll  
✅ Individuals who can identify memes via pixel, sigh, or background vine boom sound  
✅ Rizzed-up sigma anomalies who say “valid” in real convos unironically  
✅ YOU. Probably.

🎯 *What to bring:*  
–  Your most cursed, non-NPC teammate  
–  The meme lore you’ve accumulated via sleepless nights and bad decisions  
–  A will to survive whatever this is

🌪️ Expect:  
–  Flashbang trivia  
–  Lore dumps from the Backrooms  
–  Questions that feel like you’re getting ratio’d in real time  
–  Possibly the ghost of Bingus  

💀 *You won’t understand everything.*  
🧠 *That’s the point.*  
🚽 *Skibidi will be watching.*  

👁️‍🗨️ Pull up. Win prizes.  
📉 Lose neurons. Gain *AURA.*  
🔥 Prove your brainrot wasn’t in vain.

*– TVRQC*

we cant deal with cso immediately after iss
4/12/25, 6:40 PM - +91 80782 07252: Cso will be in the morning or evening if this happens??
4/12/25, 6:40 PM - +91 88074 94038: not confirmed yet
4/12/25, 6:41 PM - +91 88074 94038: worst case it will be in the morning
4/12/25, 6:42 PM - +91 80782 07252: I mean ig it's fine as long as it's in the evening? We'll be done w our papers earlier too n we can try to understand their perspective??
4/12/25, 6:42 PM - +91 99416 37224: But guys, think of it from the seniors' perspective
Would any of _you_ be willing to write two endsems, for a total of 8 credits on one single day? Would _you_ be willing to sit through a gruelling 6 hours, having no time to prepare for either exam properly?
I think not.
And if you would not be willing to do so, why can't we help out our seniors by swapping the two exams? Yes, we get a little lesser time for CSO, but if we were in their shoes, I'm certain that the moodle spam would have begun a while ago. As long as the exam is in the evening, I would suggest that we swap.
4/12/25, 6:43 PM - +91 88074 94038: ok this is a new twist
4/12/25, 6:43 PM - +91 88074 94038: what exam do the seniors have ?
4/12/25, 6:44 PM - +91 80782 07252: MDL
4/12/25, 6:47 PM - +91 99416 37224: It too is taken by Parchuri, if anyone wanted an idea as to how the course is
4/12/25, 6:48 PM - +91 88074 94038: Speaking of Parchuri , I am sure these seniors weren't disrespectful to the prof and haven't possibly messed up our grading.

4/12/25, 6:52 PM - +91 79763 44711: no lol
4/12/25, 6:52 PM - +91 79763 44711: dsa lab
4/12/25, 6:52 PM - +91 99416 37224: You surely can't be dumping the blame wholly on our seniors, have you seen section B's CSO classes?
4/12/25, 6:52 PM - +91 88074 94038: grade matters more than a free day
4/12/25, 6:52 PM - +91 91191 99815: Oh mb
Forgot about that
4/12/25, 6:53 PM - +91 99416 37224: Is that confirmed? Lokesh sir was saying something about 25th or smth yesterday iirc
4/12/25, 6:53 PM - +91 76709 60227: When is it
4/12/25, 6:53 PM - +91 79763 44711: brother theory starts on 25 wym
4/12/25, 6:53 PM - +91 79763 44711: dsa theory is 25
4/12/25, 6:53 PM - +91 72044 30421: 😞😞why u seniorcock sucking da😞😞
4/12/25, 6:53 PM - +91 88074 94038: prof isn't annoyed by an empty class , he is annoyed by people who leave immediately after attendance. The problem in section A is much worse than section B.
4/12/25, 6:53 PM - +91 72044 30421: Let's get it postponed to May 4th instead🥺🥺
4/12/25, 6:53 PM - +91 79763 44711: no we have dsa lab then
4/12/25, 6:54 PM - +91 88074 94038: dates haven't been confirmed
4/12/25, 6:54 PM - +91 99416 37224: May 4/5/6 is not even a possibility unless everyone is willing to stay back on campus (even if 1 person is not available) we won't even think of that option
4/12/25, 6:54 PM - +91 72044 30421: Lund
4/12/25, 6:54 PM - +91 99416 37224: This is what he told na
4/12/25, 6:54 PM - +91 80782 07252: It starts on 26th
4/12/25, 6:54 PM - +91 88074 94038: cant seniors get mdl preponed ?
4/12/25, 6:55 PM - +91 79763 44711: yes but there have to be 3 labs
4/12/25, 6:55 PM - +91 79763 44711: it doesnt work either way
4/12/25, 6:55 PM - +91 99416 37224: Because something tells me that we'll face the same next year, and its always nice to have some goodwill <This message was edited>
4/12/25, 6:55 PM - +91 79763 44711: or atleast 2
4/12/25, 6:55 PM - +91 88074 94038: lmao. no one will be singing your anals of goodwill.
4/12/25, 6:56 PM - +91 99416 37224: Sure...
4/12/25, 6:56 PM - +91 79763 44711: unless our schedule is

23 cso lab

4/12/25, 6:56 PM - +91 79763 44711: i dont need to explain why thats disgusting
4/12/25, 6:57 PM - +91 99893 97880: @mps will sports be there after endsems?
4/12/25, 6:57 PM - +91 99416 37224: But one also wouldn't want to be known for not helping people when they have the ability to do so
4/12/25, 6:57 PM - +91 88074 94038: Tell me why they cant prepone/postpone MDL ? I think they don't have DSA labs like we do.
4/12/25, 6:58 PM - +91 79763 44711: not everything is done for praise
4/12/25, 6:58 PM - +91 79763 44711: its empathy lol
4/12/25, 7:00 PM - +91 88074 94038: Empathy needn't be one side always.
4/12/25, 7:00 PM - +91 79763 44711: then vote no? whos stopping you
4/12/25, 7:02 PM - +91 88074 94038: @919941637224 please ask the seniors why they aren't doing this ....

4/13/25, 5:17 PM - +91 90632 81652: At least for the end lab.
We had all the graded labs first even mid lab. So it would be fair for us to have the end lab after them
4/13/25, 5:21 PM - Ojas Kataria: It's on the same day, does it really matter who goes first
4/13/25, 5:23 PM - +91 90632 81652: If it is on the same day then no. But is it confirmed?
4/13/25, 5:24 PM - +91 85200 71443: when does the doc in aarogya come in the evening?

I need Thursday lab 🙂
4/14/25, 9:56 AM - Manan: Worth trying
4/14/25, 9:58 AM - +91 70439 27535: @918688380432 Could've emailed it for the better of all secA ppl
4/14/25, 10:02 AM - +91 91005 97546: Exactly
4/14/25, 10:03 AM - +91 99893 97880: Would have been fair if this swapping was decided last week. Announcing about the swap to sec B ppl one night before the lab isnt fair. It's obvious that majority of us start the lab prep only 2 to 3 days prior...
4/14/25, 10:04 AM - +91 76709 60227: For swapping the Labs individually we should mail the proffs
4/14/25, 10:05 AM - +91 74978 08993: TAs

4/14/25, 10:07 AM - +91 76709 60227: There has been no change of now>
If Section A students want that change really badly, mail to profs /Post on Moodle with your reasons.
4/14/25, 10:07 AM - +91 76709 60227: Some days ago
4/14/25, 10:17 AM - +91 91005 97546: why can't we start a moodle thread?it's not fair to ask them to switch the labs but i think if we ask them to postpone our lab then they might do it na
4/14/25, 10:17 AM - +91 98492 33901: No iot class ryt

4/14/25, 8:54 PM - +91 63541 09703: we cannot take any sort of textbooks inside eitherways right so why don't they just check that when we go and then when we come out check our bags again for textbooks
4/14/25, 8:54 PM - +91 79763 44711: probably to stop people from having food in there
4/14/25, 8:55 PM - +91 63541 09703: they can just check the bag na 😭😭
4/14/25, 8:55 PM - +91 72040 03381: Logistical overhead

4/14/25, 8:56 PM - Poonam: agreed bro it's very annoying

4/16/25, 9:57 AM - +91 80782 07252: People w ❌ can u give reasons? We don't have any paper on 30th
4/16/25, 10:03 AM - +91 73372 95535: We'll get less time to study for ISS if it gets preponed
4/16/25, 10:04 AM - +91 99100 97808: Will it make a difference
4/16/25, 10:05 AM - +91 73372 95535: Yes it will obviously
4/16/25, 10:05 AM - +91 73372 95535: It's a full day
4/16/25, 10:07 AM - +91 88074 94038: But you will have more time to study cso
4/16/25, 10:07 AM - +91 88074 94038: Cso has more credits than iss
4/16/25, 10:08 AM - +91 73372 95535: CLD has an exam on 2nd
4/16/25, 10:08 AM - +91 93563 51244: Essentially anyone who doesn't have CSO has some other exam
4/16/25, 10:08 AM - +91 80782 07252: Didn't it get changed to 3rd?
4/16/25, 10:10 AM - +91 73372 95535: can u send the tentative schedule if it gets changed
4/16/25, 10:10 AM - +91 73372 95535: i didn't read everything in the cso group
4/16/25, 10:11 AM - +91 99416 37224: We have exams on both 2nd and 3rd, but I don't get what problem that might cause
4/16/25, 10:11 AM - +91 99416 37224: As of the last true update, our CL and CSO exams have swapped days
4/16/25, 10:11 AM - +91 99416 37224: And CSO is in the morning
4/16/25, 10:12 AM - +91 80782 07252: It doesn't change anything for you people if ISS gets shifted to 30th
4/16/25, 10:12 AM - +91 99416 37224: We were wondering whether we could prepone ISS by a day, so that CGD doesn't have 3 back to back exams
4/16/25, 10:12 AM - +91 80782 07252: So why are you objecting?
4/16/25, 10:12 AM - +91 99416 37224: We are objecting?

4/16/25, 5:15 PM - +91 79763 44711: add 2 for republic day and 3/6 for marathon
4/16/25, 5:15 PM - +91 74978 08993: 1 for republic day is already added I think
4/16/25, 5:15 PM - +91 74978 08993: And 1 for marathon <This message was edited>

The *Clubs Council introductory session* is starting in just half an hour! We understand that some recent emails have raised questions about the policies and functioning of the student body — and this session is the right space to understand the structure, our roles, and the work we do.

If you're genuinely curious about how things actually work, what goes on behind the scenes, or if you have any questions you'd like to ask — this is the perfect opportunity.

We’ll be starting sharp at 9:30 PM at H103. Hope to see you there!

4/18/25, 10:21 PM - Hemang: Guys, please do NOT leave any food out for Tofu at obh circle. Dogs from other packs end up coming there for it and they trouble Tofu. If you want to feed anything to her (surely nothing too sweet/spicy/oily), do so only if you're staying with her while she eats it. 
Also: recently there was an incident of a dog accidentally consuming chocolate cake at BBC, because some group celebrating a bday just left the cake there after the celebration. Please be more careful with food around dogs.

Then the parts that they give finally don't work .
4/18/25, 11:21 PM - +91 93445 29774: And then they'll dock points if we don't use each and every sensor that they gave
4/18/25, 11:21 PM - +91 88074 94038: They atleast take a week to get new parts.
