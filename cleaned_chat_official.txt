For now, we would like to highlight that you don't have to rush through the process. We would like you to learn out of your own interest when you are comfortable. We do not force it as a requirement that you have to accomplish right away. As discussed in today's meet, we are in the process of planning future events to troubleshoot any problems you may face.

Hey Guys! Your classes will be starting from tomorrow. This marks the start of a new and exciting phase in your lives. Commence this journey with an open and receptive mind. Be sincere and resilient and focus on your acads; but also remember to find the time slow down, meet new people, pursue hobbies and explore new things. There will be highs and there will be lows, but remember that you have an entire village to help you out. Ask for help when you need it, give people help when they need it. Stay steadfast and you‚Äôll push through. This is beginning to feel a lot like a cringe motivational video so I‚Äôll stop, but one last thing before I do. Make new memories and cherish them. Those are the things that will stay on with you. Do reach out to us or your seniors and we‚Äôll be more than happy to help you. All the best!üåüüåüüåü Rishabh
Have Breakfast! ~ Soumil :)
thank you sar
Also guys! Ensure to be on time.. atleast until uk the prof is chill about timings
My two cents as well: Slow Down: you're about to go through a lot of stuff - academics, making new friends, participating in events, going to your PE sessions :), and so much more. It is absolutely normal to feel overwhelmed at times, everyone does. Slow down, figure out what can wait, what cannot, act accordingly. There are tens of batches who came before you, faced the same challenges and overcame it, you'll do so too. Manage your time, there's plenty of space for everything. I'm sure you'll sail though your college life. Best!
I am seeing many UG1 out Strictly saying 7pm curfew lagayenge.....
Even now I am seeing Ug1 out... If u think breaking rules is fun....Just think of hvg a 7pm curfew...Take the curfew seriously...

Hey everyone, I‚Äôve had a few questions about the curfew so I‚Äôll clarify here - *Hostel Curfew* ends on the *11th of August.* (Night of the Batch Trip) *Campus Curfew* ends on the *17th of August.* (Night of freshers)
We hope you all are enjoying your induction events. To add up to the fun, Cultural Council brings you, not 1 but 2 events on 17th August :- 1)Freshers' Night 2)Mr. and Ms. Flair All of the rules and guidelines will be shared with all of you tomorrow (6th August) at Amphitheatre at 9:30 p.m. which will be followed by individual house meets. If you haven't danced, sang, played any instrument or taken part in a skit ever before, this is the best opportunity to give it a try and explore your talents. Hope to see you all there!!
To reach the yoga class: When you go to Yuktahar from Kandamb, keep climbing up one more floor and you shall reach the yoga room.
Just in case somebody didn't get the name in their arts they will mostly have their arts in second half
Labs include but aren't limited to KCIS, Thub
If you give attendance on paper, wait for a week from the date of the class in order for the attendance to reflect. If you are still marked absent/you used biometric: Ask others in your batch if they have also been marked absent and send a collective mail.
Reminder please come to Amphi for Hook Step Hype Fest by The Dance Crew, it's starting nowwww, it'll be a super fun event (maybe DJ also)!!!!!
Hey all:) In case someone missed collecting few books that were issued during reporting they can collect it from Library tmrw from 2pm to 5pm.
Hey Guys!!! The event is stilll going on!! Clarifying as many of u had doubts!
Tdc waale smh smh
first report to the football ground
warm up
give attendance and then go for gym
otherwise you won't get attendance
@919535499671 can you confirm once?
For Yoga, you can directly go to Yoga hall, not to the football ground
Goes for any service really, if you are calling someone, say to repair your laptop, firstly it has to be before 10PM. and they won't be allowed to come inside hostel. Hostel common area near the entrance is the maximum they are allowed to step in.
If it rains, unless its like andhi toofan: you still have to go to football ground in your sports attire. depending on the situation of rain and the ground, it will be the call of Mr. Nagaraju to decide whether sports will happen or not. In either case, you have to go to the ground for attendance. You can't be like "sAr bUt tOo mUcH rAiN sAr mE ScArEd". Got it? Good.
sAr bUt tOo mUcH rAiN sAr mE ScArEd" WOW

Is there any ece student who has been allotted batch 2 in arts? Please react here
Did arts 2 list release Someone react ASAP
English list came??
Or conversely, is there any ece student who is not been allotted batch 1 or the English class?
Hey guys, I think some of you are still a bit confused about the arts-1 course. I‚Äôll clarify it here: If you might remember you wrote an *English diagnostic test* on your second day. If you *passed that test*, then you have been allowed to attend the *arts 1 course*. If you *failed that test*, you have been assigned to go for *English classes* and you *will not* be attending the arts 1 course. If you have received the arts email but not the English class email then it means you have passed the test and will be taking arts. Don‚Äôt worry if your name wasn‚Äôt in the batch 1 list it‚Äôll be sent later.
I just wanted to tell one more thing this week you will be having your batch trip. Please take care of your health we want everyone to come to batch trip.

[IMPORTANT] Regd. Paper Checking & Distribution and return tickets. Will keep it brief. End-sems are supposed to end on 29 Nov 2024. "ideally" you can leave for home after that but there are a few reasons not to do so immediately: 1. Paper checking and distribution duration is from 1 Dec to 5 Dec, meaning your TAs will most probably check your papers and show it to you during this duration. 2. You cannot almost certainly have any paper showing online, meaning, if you do go to home during this period, you will miss the paper showing and will not get a chance to increase your marks if you so wish. 3. Projects: This semester for example, at least to my knowledge, ECX may have a project in the course: EW-1. Project evaluations are almost always after the endsems so that you have enough time to prepare for it. In this case, you cannot go home directly after exams end as evaluations also do not happen online. So in an ideal case, it's safe to book your return tickets around or after 6th Dec. But I would suggest to wait for some time and get dates confirmed in each courses so that you can be absolutely sure you won't miss anything after you go back home. hope this clears some of the confusion.
[Money Saving tips] If you guys go out to eat, use Swiggy Dineout/Zomato Bookings and get discounts. Don't pay full amount lol.
it's actually crazy how so many people don't use this

We have heard that quite a few of you are feeling unwell lately, with some experiencing high fever and severe headaches. As exams are also approaching, it is really important that we all take care of ourselves during this time. Please remember to: - Get enough sleep. - Maintain good hygiene (wash your hands regularly and keep your surroundings clean). - Stay hydrated and Try avoiding outside meals. - Do some of exercising to stay fit. Also, If you‚Äôre not feeling well, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out for medical help.
I wish all the girl students to be there because it's you guys who will be next generation will be handling such instants on college and you have the complete right to ask about these things
This is regarding the FSIS session that begins at 5:00 PM today, in H-105. All female students do attend the session.
yes
Come on guys speak up!!
Guys! One more thing I want to highlight is if you feeling low and wanna talk and discuss smtg we are always there.
also yeah like take care of your friends and peers. you're all mature enough to solve stuff this like out amongst yourself. also it's an important life skill so why not.
midsems are coming up so let's make sure we're having some helping hands for each other.
Reminder for the event :)
*UG1 MIDSEMS PSA* Please keep the following in mind regarding the midsem examinations. 1. *CARRY YOUR VALID PERMANENT ID CARD*. If you forget this, absolutely no one can help you: the dean is extremely strict about the no ID = no exam policy. 2. Remember to be at your exam room/hall *ateast 20 minutes before* the paper starts. Do not forget to carry a pen, most likely invigilators will *NOT allow you to borrow* anything. 3. *DO NOT carry your mobile phones*, earbuds, or any other elecronic devices. If you do, carry your bags so you can keep electronics in the bags outside the exam room. You will NOT be allowed to keep the phone on the teacher's table, or give it to the invigilator, or anything like that. 4. Any violation of the exam rules can attract strong penalties including, but not limited to, being asked to leave the exam, recommend an F grade for the course, or drop a semester. *MPs cannot do anything about disciplinary action taken by the institute, do not rely on us for that please.* If you have any issues with the ID cards, or questions about the midsems, please feel free to message any of the MPs. All the best!
On behalf of your mps
Also I‚Äôve updated the description with the list of mps and their contact information
Also on behalf of the mps
Congratulations for the new MPs‚ô•Ô∏èü•≥
congrats again :)
Gud luck for u r mids! One of the key milestones is this examination so make sure u give u r 100%
Guys please please don't take ID card thing as a joke Many were not able to write their exams because they didn't hv Id Clg will strictly check them tmrw and invigilators will be professors not students.
Also, on a different topic, please share some contacts of your friends/roommates with your parents in case they ever want to reach out to you and you are not available.
Guys again saying please make sure u take this seriously
All the best for dsm guys :) Remember to stay calm during the exam. Take a water bottle and your ID card with you
Also no electronic devices in the exam hall
Also guys, no sports during midsems
that includes any smartwatch etc- btw.
Some of you had doubts about how grading works, I'll briefly explain: For each course you'll get a grade (an integer value) e.g: 8 (B) or 10 (A, also kassi get a life, jking) or 9 (A-) etc-. The grade that you get depends on the relative performance with your batch and also on the prof, in the sense that they get to decide how many people they want to get A, A-, B etc -.. Now, each course has a credit attached with it. Think of it as a weight in the weighted average. So say you have only two course (just an example): X and Y, X is 4 creds and Y is 5 creds, You get an A- (9) in X and a B (8) in Y. That means your SG (Sem CG) will be (4*9+5*8)/4+5 which is approximately 8.45. The CGPA is the cumulative (again, like a weighted AVG) over all the sems you've completed till that time.
This is the fourth time this has been explained :/ Just save this message for future reference guys
Yes, this should not be coming up again and again.
On behalf of your mps
I hope your mid-exams went well. Have fun for the next few days! One of the major events is going to happen, and trust me, it's going to be amazing. Participate as much as you can. Please make sure to perform in cultural events and many more. Take some time to relax and enjoy!
Guys one more most important thing while you are messaging TAs or any sr make sure u write context Don't just write hi , can I call,can I meet..... Hw will someone knows the reason If it's smtg imp hw will someone knows to hold or proceed
POLL: will you be able to pass sports? (just curious) OPTION: yessir :) (126 votes) OPTION: no :( (50 votes)
guys if you can, pull it up this sem as much as possible. make sure you don't slack off in the next semesters :)
@ug1 excellent work on all the megathon problem statements, you guys did really well, even when it was your first time
Happy Diwali Everyone! ü™î‚ú® Hope you have a great year ahead and god bless üôè
Hi everyone! Do check out the Google AI booth thingy at KCIS ground floor in a while. They do have some cool goodies :)
proud of you all :)
Hey! Hope everyone is enjoying the semester and the college life by now and are settled in peacefully. While most people have been having a good time (except the acads ofc), there have been a few cases where the folks haven‚Äôt been comfortable yet since they faced some sort of arrogance/misconduct from their batchmates. Sadly, this year we have seen more cases of intra-batch issues than inter-batch. Making fun of people / teasing them unnecessarily / badly behaving with them in any sort of way comes under the jurisdiction of ragging. As you might know, any sort of such cases lead to severe consequences including termination from college. Acting inappropriately or causing trouble to anyone isn‚Äôt the correct way to have fun. Apex was made to ensure a healthy and safe environment for each and every student at IIIT and we along with college authorities shall not be bearing any such cases anymore and try to resolve them internally, but directly report to the authorities. Hope the people who are getting involved in such activities realise these things and stop indulging in them immediately. PS : If you want to have some fun, bug your Apex mentors and heads, we‚Äôll do cluster meets
have fun, not at the expense of others.
Master of the succinct üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Yes yes very true, few more important things: 1. Please ensure there are no scribblings or markings on your hands or legs when you enter the exam hall. 2. Make sure to bring your ID card to the exam hall; it is mandatory for entry. 3. You are NOT allowed to carry personal belongings such as phones into the exam hall. To avoid any risk of theft near the exam venue (as we‚Äôve had incidents in the past), it is strongly advised to leave them in your room.

Senior leaders from Goldman Sachs will be sharing valuable insights into their corporate journey and discussing the dynamic culture of the finance industry.

Hey everyone, hope you are doing well, now that exams are over. We expect civil behavior from you all in and around the labs (T-Hub, KCIS, Vindhya). You are free to roam around and do your masti anywhere in the campus as long as its safe, but kindly understand that labs are supposed to be quiet places as there are hundred of students focusing on their studies, research, etc-. Moreover, a lot of profs have their offices as well. Take this as a reminder and ensure there is a certain decorum maintained in these places. More so because you are not even allowed here in the first place. Don't make us call you out.
Please guys, you are ideally not allowed to enter lab spaces. Do not take advantage over our leniency. Research students are working at various times in their labs and before they start complaining about you guys, try to control your behavior. There are a lot lot more places in campus to have fun, lab spaces aint them. Anyways Happy holidays, ab toh baahar ghoom lo before sem starts again :)
ghum rahe hai sir yeh log kabse kahtam hi nahi ho raha inka üòÇ

random question: does ug1 not prefer going to bbc? i generally have not noticed a lot of ug1s here! (react with üëç/üëé)

Hey guys, just a reminder - when you reply to emails that have been sent to the entire student body, please don‚Äôt hit the reply all button if you only need to reply to the sender. Use the reply button instead which will ensure the email only goes to the sender. (I‚Äôve made the mistake a few times :))

Hey all, If you want to use a courier service anytime in your time here at IIIT: I'll just brief you with some options. College has a service you can give it somewhere in admin office (not sure where exactly), they courier it for you. Another way which I'll personally suggest is: 1. If you can walk till DLF, there's DTDC office, just drop it there. Have personally done twice this with expensive stuff so i trust it. 2. If you want pickup service they'll come to IIIT for some additional amount (around 50-100) and they'll do the rest.
IIITH DTDC.vcf (file attached)
This is their contact ^
Pickup service can also be availed from their app. Save this it'll probably help sometime.
Happy New Year everyone! üéä üéâ have a great one ahead :)
All the best for your second semester guys!
Welcome back to 1.5 hour long classes :)
Hi all, Writing this again to reiterate some points that are important to keep in mind. If you‚Äôre struggling in academics or feeling low, please know that we‚Äôre always here to help you through whatever phase you‚Äôre in. Don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out, we‚Äôve got your back!! üí™ There‚Äôs been a lot of rumors and baseless allegations going around, and it‚Äôs not acceptable. If you don‚Äôt have evidence, please avoid making such claims about your own batch mates. Let‚Äôs maintain some respect. If you notice someone who seems off or has changed and might need help, don‚Äôt wait report it to us ASAP so we can help and support them. If people are getting _not so usual_ messages from someone in the batch. Please ignore them and let us know.

Guys, as you know, Chicken Pox is spreading. So be a little more careful about your hygiene and try to avoid close contact with people for some time. And inform the Parliament if you happen to have any symptoms. Stay Safe and atb for endsems and projects!
Adding to that plss pls take note: 1. Initial symptoms include rashes (which may be accompanied by blister in later stage) 2. Fever (low or high either) 3. Fatigue and loss of appetite Also symptoms take a week or more to actually show up ... So ppl might b infected but themselves be unaware of the same So pls try to not b in crowded places at least. And people who have had it in the past or are vaccinated are less prone but can still get it . So pls be careful anyway ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Reminder! Deadline 6PM.
