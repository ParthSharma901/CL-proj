8/4/24, 10:12 PM - Rishabh Patnaik Apex: Hey Guys! 

Your classes will be starting from tomorrow. This marks the start of a new and exciting phase in your lives. Commence this journey with an open and receptive mind. Be sincere and resilient and focus on your acads; but also remember to find the time slow down, meet new people, pursue hobbies and explore new things. 

There will be highs and there will be lows, but remember that you have an entire village to help you out. Ask for help when you need it, give people help when they need it. Stay steadfast and you’ll push through.

This is beginning to feel a lot like a cringe motivational video so I’ll stop, but one last thing before I do. Make new memories and cherish them. Those are the things that will stay on with you. 

Do reach out to us or your seniors and we’ll be more than happy to help you.

All the best!🌟🌟🌟
Rishabh
8/4/24, 10:13 PM - Soumil Gupta Apex: Have Breakfast!

~ Soumil :)
8/4/24, 10:21 PM - Soumil Gupta Apex: thank you sar
8/4/24, 10:27 PM - Yashaswi Apex: Also guys! Ensure to be on time.. atleast until uk the prof is chill about timings
8/4/24, 10:28 PM - Soumil Gupta Apex: My two cents as well:

Slow Down: you're about to go through a lot of stuff - academics, making new friends, participating in events, going to your PE sessions :), and so much more. It is absolutely normal to feel overwhelmed at times, everyone does. Slow down, figure out what can wait, what cannot, act accordingly. There are tens of batches who came before you, faced the same challenges and overcame it, you'll do so too. Manage your time, there's plenty of space for everything. 

I'm sure you'll sail though your college life. 

Best!

8/5/24, 5:28 PM - Hardik Apex(CLD): Hey everyone,
Since a lot of people are not in the other unofficial group and due to the fact that there are a lot of people who are not from your batch or iiit in general are part of that group, you can join this group and continue your discussions here for your whole batch.

Please do not share it with anyone else outside your batch and especially outside college.

https://chat.whatsapp.com/HHUsNRomBQBEMp1mbX1oZf

(Also if anyone wants to take the responsibility of adding their batchmates and making sure that no people from outside iiit join the group, please DM we’ll make them the admin)

8/7/24, 7:09 PM - Nikhita Apex: Did arts 2 list release 

Someone react ASAP
8/7/24, 7:12 PM - Nikhita Apex: English list came??
8/7/24, 7:13 PM - Rishabh Patnaik Apex: Or conversely, is there any ece student who is not been allotted batch 1 or the English class?
8/7/24, 7:27 PM - Rishabh Patnaik Apex: Hey guys, 

I think some of you are still a bit confused about the arts-1 course. I’ll clarify it here: 

If you might remember you wrote an *English diagnostic test* on your second day. If you *passed that test*, then you have been allowed to attend the *arts 1 course*. 

If you *failed that test*, you have been assigned to go for *English classes* and you *will not* be attending the arts 1 course. 

If you have received the arts email but not the English class email then it means you have passed the test and will be taking arts. Don’t worry if your name wasn’t in the batch 1 list it’ll be sent later.

The time is nigh and the tickets are selling out quick. Register NOW at https://ecell.iiit.ac.in/fail24 . We hope to see you there on September 8th!

Hello Everyone,

In memory of the Kolkata doctor whose life was brutally cut short, let us gather in silence today to demand justice for her.

Let's light a candle tonight to support every woman who has ever experienced a hate crime, for you, me and all our future daughters.

As we celebrate our nation’s independence today, let’s also take a small but significant step in the fight against injustice in India.

*Venue: Amphitheatre*
*Time: 9:30 PM*
(Candles will be provided; however, we encourage you to bring your own as well.)

8/18/24, 1:51 PM - Soumil Gupta Apex: as far as syllabus etc - is concerned, this is best answered by your course instructor. Do approach them towards near the quiz date and ask them to mention the syllabus clearly, although most instructors will inform it directly on their own.

9/5/24, 11:22 AM - Nikhita Apex: Today, on Teachers' Day, take a moment to express gratitude to the teachers who have shaped your journey and helped you reach where you are today. Acknowledge the support of your parents for their nurturing, your siblings, and anyone who has guided and taught you valuable lessons along the way.
9/5/24, 12:51 PM - Soumil Gupta Apex: thanks to @senior_apex for guiding us as well!
9/5/24, 6:37 PM - Soumil Gupta Apex: [IMPORTANT] Regd. Paper Checking & Distribution and return tickets. 

Will keep it brief. End-sems are supposed to end on 29 Nov 2024. "ideally" you can leave for home after that but there are a few reasons not to do so immediately:

1. Paper checking and distribution duration is from 1 Dec to 5 Dec, meaning your TAs will most probably check your papers and show it to you during this duration.

2. You cannot almost certainly have any paper showing online, meaning, if you do go to home during this period, you will miss the paper showing and will not get a chance to increase your marks if you so wish. 

3. Projects: This semester for example, at least to my knowledge, ECX may have a project in the course: EW-1. Project evaluations are almost always after the endsems so that you have enough time to prepare for it. In this case, you cannot go home directly after exams end as evaluations also do not happen online. 

So in an ideal case, it's safe to book your return tickets around or after 6th Dec. But I would suggest to wait for some time and get dates confirmed in each courses so that you can be absolutely sure you won't miss anything after you go back home.

hope this clears some of the confusion.
9/6/24, 10:48 AM - Soumil Gupta Apex: [Money Saving tips] If you guys go out to eat, use Swiggy Dineout/Zomato Bookings and get discounts.  Don't pay full amount lol.

9/19/24, 3:35 PM - Rishabh Patnaik Apex: *UG1 MIDSEMS PSA*

Please keep the following in mind regarding the midsem examinations.

1. *CARRY YOUR VALID PERMANENT ID CARD*. If you forget this, absolutely no one can help you: the dean is extremely strict about the no ID = no exam policy.
2. Remember to be at your exam room/hall *ateast 20 minutes before* the paper starts. Do not forget to carry a pen, most likely invigilators will *NOT allow you to borrow* anything.
3. *DO NOT carry your mobile phones*, earbuds, or any other elecronic devices. If you do, carry your bags so you can keep electronics in the bags outside the exam room. You will NOT be allowed to keep the phone on the teacher's table, or give it to the invigilator, or anything like that.
4. Any violation of the exam rules can attract strong penalties including, but not limited to, being asked to leave the exam, recommend an F grade for the course, or drop a semester. *MPs cannot do anything about disciplinary action taken by the institute, do not rely on us for that please.*

If you have any issues with the ID cards, or questions about the midsems, please feel free to message any of the MPs. All the best!

9/20/24, 4:05 PM - Soumil Gupta Apex: that includes any smartwatch etc- btw.
9/21/24, 10:09 AM - Soumil Gupta Apex: Some of you had doubts about how grading works, I'll briefly explain:

For each course you'll get a grade (an integer value) e.g: 8 (B) or 10 (A, also kassi get a life, jking) or 9 (A-) etc-. 

The grade that you get depends on the relative performance with your batch and also on the prof, in the sense that they get to decide how many people they want to get A, A-, B etc -..

Now, each course has a credit attached with it. Think of it as a weight in the weighted average.

So say you have only two course (just an example): X and Y, X is 4 creds and Y is 5 creds, You get an A- (9) in X and a B (8) in Y. That means your SG (Sem CG) will be (4*9+5*8)/4+5 which is approximately 8.45.

The CGPA is the cumulative (again, like a weighted AVG) over all the sems you've completed till that time.
9/21/24, 10:10 AM - Rishabh Patnaik Apex: This is the fourth time this has been explained :/

Just save this message for future reference guys
9/21/24, 10:10 AM - Soumil Gupta Apex: Yes, this should not be coming up again and again.
9/24/24, 3:03 PM - Rishabh Patnaik Apex: Hi everyone,

Thank you for your participation and creativity!✨ <This message was edited>

11/14/24, 2:58 PM - Hardik Apex(CLD): Hey!
Hope everyone is enjoying the semester and the college life by now and are settled in peacefully.

While most people have been having a good time (except the acads ofc), there have been a few cases where the folks haven’t been comfortable yet since they faced some sort of arrogance/misconduct from their batchmates.

Sadly, this year we have seen more cases of intra-batch issues than inter-batch. Making fun of people / teasing them unnecessarily / badly behaving with them in any sort of way comes under the jurisdiction of ragging. As you might know, any sort of such cases lead to severe consequences including termination from college.

Acting inappropriately or causing trouble to anyone isn’t the correct way to have fun. Apex was made to ensure a healthy and safe environment for each and every student at IIIT and we along with college authorities shall not be bearing any such cases anymore and try to resolve them internally, but directly report to the authorities.

Hope the people who are getting involved in such activities realise these things and stop indulging in them immediately.

PS : If you want to have some fun, bug your Apex mentors and heads, we’ll do cluster meets
11/14/24, 3:05 PM - Soumil Gupta Apex: have fun, not at the expense of others.
11/14/24, 3:07 PM - Rishabh Patnaik Apex: Master of the succinct 🙇‍♀️

Don't panic and don't misplace your ID cards!

Have a great vacation in December, free of all coursework 🥳 <This message was edited>
11/16/24, 3:01 PM - Harshit G 👾 Apex: Yes yes very true, few more important things:
1. Please ensure there are no scribblings or markings on your hands or legs when you enter the exam hall.
2. Make sure to bring your ID card to the exam hall; it is mandatory for entry.
3. You are NOT allowed to carry personal belongings such as phones into the exam hall. To avoid any risk of theft near the exam venue (as we’ve had incidents in the past), it is strongly advised to leave them in your room.

We expect civil behavior from you all in and around the labs (T-Hub, KCIS, Vindhya). You are free to roam around and do your masti anywhere in the campus as long as its safe, but kindly understand that labs are supposed to be quiet places as there are hundred of students focusing on their studies, research, etc-. Moreover, a lot of profs have their offices as well. 

Take this as a reminder and ensure there is a certain decorum maintained in these places. More so because you are not even allowed here in the first place. 
Don't make us call you out.
12/2/24, 1:22 AM - Soumil Gupta Apex pinned a message
12/2/24, 1:26 AM - Yashaswi Apex: Please guys, you are ideally not allowed to enter lab spaces. Do not take advantage over our leniency. Research students are working at various times in their labs and before they start complaining about you guys, try to control your behavior. There are a lot lot more places in campus to have fun, lab spaces aint them. 

Anyways Happy holidays, ab toh baahar ghoom lo before sem starts again :)

12/15/24, 7:51 PM - Soumil Gupta Apex: i hate to do this but, just to clarify:
since some of you are studying/trying to study DSA for the next semester. Just a small heads up that DSA in IIIT-H is taught in C and not C++/Python or any other language. Aim is to learn how to make the data structures from scratch and not just use it. So if you intend on studying DSA, try to go though tutorials which teach it in C, examples include but are not limited to Code with Harry. <This message was edited>
12/16/24, 2:28 PM - Yashaswi Apex: Now that all your grades are out (Hopefully), Congratulations on finishing your first senester guys! Some of you must be really happy, some of u must be sad, irrespective, u ll did great in the semester. Now forget about what’s done, and think about what u can do guys! Look forward to the next semester. You ll can get a headstart with some DSA as mentioned by Soumil, or can do CP, or anythng. Anyways have fun guys! Party hard for NYE.

12/30/24, 12:17 PM - Rishabh Patnaik Apex: Hey guys, just a reminder - when you reply to emails that have been sent to the entire student body, please don’t hit the reply all button if you only need to reply to the sender. Use the reply button instead which will ensure the email only goes to the sender. (I’ve made the mistake a few times :))
12/30/24, 3:15 PM - Soumil Gupta Apex: risabh bhai leading my example 🔥
12/30/24, 5:11 PM - +91 95354 99671: On 28th December, while our email accounts were stuck in transitioning, a few lucky individuals received the new mess policy. What does it mean for you?

We unpack it all in our new article: http://pingiiit.org/the-mess-y-situation/
12/30/24, 5:43 PM - Rishabh Patnaik Apex: Loved the frog on the mushroom :)
12/31/24, 8:19 PM - Soumil Gupta Apex: Hey all, 

If you want to use a courier service anytime in your time here at IIIT: I'll just brief you with some options.

College has a service you can give it somewhere in admin office (not sure where exactly), they courier it for you. Another way which I'll personally suggest is: 

1. If you can walk till DLF, there's DTDC office, just drop it there. Have personally done twice this with expensive stuff so i trust it. 

2. If you want pickup service they'll come to IIIT for some additional amount (around 50-100) and they'll do the rest.
12/31/24, 8:19 PM - Soumil Gupta Apex: IIITH DTDC.vcf (file attached)
12/31/24, 8:20 PM - Soumil Gupta Apex: This is their contact ^
12/31/24, 8:20 PM - Soumil Gupta Apex: Pickup service can also be availed from their app. 

Save this it'll probably help sometime.
1/1/25, 12:04 AM - Soumil Gupta Apex: Happy New Year everyone! 🎊 🎉 
have a great one ahead :)
1/1/25, 3:16 PM - +91 95354 99671: Over the past week, there has been some significant changes to the mess policy. As a student community, what do we feel about it? What are things we can do?

For this and more, check out our second article, https://pingiiit.org/we-are-so-cooked/
1/1/25, 3:18 PM - +91 95354 99671: Second article is up! Do check it out :>
1/2/25, 10:12 AM - Yashaswi Apex: All the best for your second semester guys!
1/2/25, 10:47 AM - Nikhita Apex: Hope you all had a wonderful holiday and are excited for the new semester. As you move into the second semester, the journey might get a bit more challenging, but I'm confident you’ll handle it well. Balancing academics, extracurriculars, and personal life is key, so make sure to stay organized and focused.  
You now have one semester of experience, which I’m sure will help you navigate things better. However, if you ever feel the need for guidance or support, remember we are always here for you ready to help and clarify any doubts.  

Good luck for this semester, and enjoy Felicity🩷 <This message was edited>
1/2/25, 11:00 AM - Rishabh Patnaik Apex: Welcome back to 1.5 hour long classes :)
1/8/25, 4:17 PM - Nikhita Apex: Hi all,  

Writing this again to reiterate some points that are important to keep in mind.

If you’re struggling in academics or feeling low, please know that we’re always here to help you through whatever phase you’re in. Don’t hesitate to reach out, we’ve got your back!! 💪

There’s been a lot of rumors and baseless allegations going around, and it’s not acceptable. If you don’t have evidence, please avoid making such claims about your own batch mates. Let’s maintain some respect.  

If you notice someone who seems off or has changed and might need help, don’t wait report it to us ASAP so we can help and support them.  

If people are getting  _not so usual_  messages from someone in the batch. Please ignore them and let us know. If you are uncomfortable with them please let us know and feel free to approach the campus counselors for any help.

So please keep these points in your mind and act accordingly.
1/10/25, 11:57 PM - +91 95354 99671: Why did we move from the older mess system? Why a weekly registration system, instead of a daily registration?

3/14/25, 11:42 PM - Hardik Apex(CLD): Hey everyone!!

Just a small reminder that while academics are important, you don’t need to stress yourself about them very much and that they are not the only thing that matters in college. First most important thing is taking care of yourselves before anything else. There is so much more to college and college life in general except academics. 

You don’t need to worry if exams didn’t go as well as expected, since almost half of the semester is left which can totally turn the tables.

In case you are facing any difficulties in any courses, feel free to approach the TAs during their office hours mentioned in moodle, help cell or the professors.

If you feel stressed or overwhelmed, we are always here for you to discuss things and rant together about academics ( and of course feel free to approach the mental health support group volunteers or the counsellors )

Happy holii and take caree!! ❤️

4/21/25, 11:36 AM - Soumil Gupta Apex: Guys, as you know, Chicken Pox is spreading. So be a little more careful about your hygiene and try to avoid close contact with people for some time. And inform the Parliament if you  happen to have any symptoms.

Stay Safe and atb for endsems and projects!
4/21/25, 11:41 AM - Pratishtha Apex: Adding to that plss pls take note:
1. Initial symptoms include rashes (which may be accompanied by blister in later stage)

2. Fever (low or high either)

3. Fatigue and loss of appetite

Also symptoms take a week or more to actually show up  ... So ppl might b infected but themselves be unaware of the same 
So pls try to not b in crowded places at least.
And people who have had it in the past or are vaccinated are less prone but can still get it . So pls be careful anyway ❤️❤️
